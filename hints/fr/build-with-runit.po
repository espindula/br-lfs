"The LFS book installs SysVinit and a set of bootscripts. Together these "
"provide the mechanism for starting processes that run under the Linux "
"Kernel, and every process is a child of 'init', process one. Other schemes "
"exist, notably the BSD-init scripts, but these are just an alternative set "
"of scripts. This hint uses runit http://smarden.org/runit/ by Gerrit Pape, a "
"completely different scheme that replaces init, and all its paraphernalia "
"(with its own paraphernalia). Runit is derived from the ideas of DJ "
"Bernstein, but the applications can easily be installed in FHS conformant "
"places."
