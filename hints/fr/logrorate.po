"Logrotate is an utility to take care of the log files of your system. It "
"keeps track of the size of the log files, and \"rotates\" them when "
"needed. That means the utility checks the size of the files, and if one of "
"them is larger than a certain size, the program performs some actions. That "
"action can be: backup and compress the file, remove it or mail it to an "
"user, create a new empty log file, and others."
