msgid ""
"systemd, while being a new and exciting daemon control system, can often be "
"very invasive with how it works with other system tools, daemon services, "
"and even various software sets.  Not only that but systemd is rather large "
"at 410MB and requires 4.5 SBUs of time to build and install. The overall "
"space of the actual installation is around 60-65MB or so, but still it's "
"rather large by fair comparison."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: origin/eudev-alt-hint.txt:44
msgid ""
"Eudev is smaller considerably at 7.4MB and faster to build at 0.3 SBUs, and "
"provides the same functionality of systemd-udev utilzied by LFS/BLFS minus "
"the service management functionality, alternative init, and isn't invasive "
"to the environment requiring itself to be a hard dependency."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: origin/eudev-alt-hint.txt:49
msgid ""
"There are other reasons people would choose to not use systemd that are more "
"personal, political, and are opinions directed at the maintainers of systemd "
"and systemd's ultimate goal, but those are best left for another discussion "
"topic elsewhere."

"The point of eudev is to ask this as a question, why install all of systemd "
"just for udev, when all you want is udev? The answer is obvious, you install "
"eudev. If you don't need or want systemd, why even bother with it?"
