"During the testing and experimenting with an installation using LDAP and "
"Kerberos is where my idea of resurrecting nss_db came about. I wanted a way "
"to have local access to the LDAP user/group information. Because PADL "
"software already had the nss_updatedb package, all there was for me to do "
"was figure out how my LFS system could use nss_db. Thanks to the help of the "
"folks mentioned below and a little perseverance on my part, nss_db is now "
"available to LFS users. Enjoy!"
