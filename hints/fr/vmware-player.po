"Once in a while there still the need for access to an Windows system, for "

"yust to enjoy the fun of screwing something up.  In the past there was a "
"free version of vmware for personal use, but that changed and since running "
"bochs is somewhat cpu consuming thats no option for an production "
"enviroment.  Now there is a free vmware player (still closed source "
"unfortunatly) wich can play machines created by a (non free) vmware version, "
