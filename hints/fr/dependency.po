"DESCRIPTION: This is for newbies who install things from the BLFS book for "
"the very first time. You cannot install the BLFS book from top to "
"bottom. Sooner or later you will get to some package, that depends on other "
"packages, that depend on even more other packages. This hint shall help you "
