"SYNOPSIS: Improve w3m's rendering of PRE text blocks so as to improve "
"readability of the LFS/BLFS/+ instruction book in w3m."

"DESCRIPTION: Using w3m to read the [B]LFS book is hindered by w3m's lack of "
"sufficient \"standout\" for PRE text blocks. Since the [B]LFS books "
"deliberately enclose all build instructions inside of PRE tags, improving "
"such content's readability will improve the [B]LFS build process."

"PREREQUISITES: This hint expects that you are familiar with the build "
"process of LFS, since that effort requires similiar actions, mainly: "
"acquiring source, unpacking and patching that source, configuring, building "

msgid ""
"Background: When reading the instruction books for [B]LFS via w3m, one must "
"pay careful attention to distinguish the \"DO THIS\" command instructions "
"from the surrounding text. This extra effort is due to w3m's lack of "
"suitable 'jumpout' rendering for PRE text blocks. Here is an example: From "
"LFS 6.5, Chapter 4.3"
