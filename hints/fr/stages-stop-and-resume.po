"For those who have built their own LFS systems more than once, they must be "
"very \"impressed\" with the extremely long building time. In particular, if "
"the computer is not a powerful one. It is quite scary to learn about such "
"lengthy building time."

"Sometimes, you may be forced to shutdown or reboot the computer, which you "
"have to resume your previous working conditions before continuing the "
"job. However, this process would be quite confusing to those who are not "
"familiar with the principles of LFS and they are likely to have difficulties "
"in resuming their previous building environment. To avoid this from "
"happening, they often keep the computer running for several days until the "
"whole LFS is finished."

"Thus it is very useful to know how to have a smooth connection after a "
"reboot/shutdown. Based on my own experiences I did a research on this topic "
"and would like to share my results. Every steps are carefully verified and "

"own LFS system and relief some of their \"pains\"."
