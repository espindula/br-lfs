"DESCRIPTION: >From 'man 8 prelink': Prelink is a program which modifies ELF "
"shared libraries and ELF dynamically linked binaries, so that the time which "
"dynamic linker needs for their relocation at startup significantly decreases "
"and also due to fewer relocations the run-time memory consumption decreases "
"too (especially number of unshareable pages). Such prelinking information is "
"only used if all its dependant libraries have not changed since prelinking, "
"otherwise programs are relocated normally."

"- First of all, never strip (or otherwise modify) programs or libraries "
"after they are prelinked. If you strip a prelinked program, the prelink "
"application will not undo it because it has been modified. Even if a program "
"is already stripped and you strip it again this will change the timestamp on "
"the ELF header sections. If you want to strip all your programs after they "
"are prelinked, first undo the prelinking with 'prelink -amu'."

"- Secondly you need at least 50 megabytes of free space to prelink the whole "
"system; up to 200 megabytes of free space is needed if you have a lot "
"installed.  If you do not have that much free space then only prelink a few "
"programs at a time."

"- Thirdly, if you plan to use the X11 windowing system with prelinking you "
"should install a position independent version of libGL.so. By default the "
"libGL.so library that is included with X11 is not a true shared object, it "
"does not use shared memory, and can not be prelinked (so nothing linked to "
"it can be be prelinked). It is suggested that you install a patch to make "
"libGL.so use use position independent assembly code:"
