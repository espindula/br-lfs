"DESCRIPTION: Background: Tactical Ops (\"TacOps\" from now on) was "
"originally an Unreal Tournament mod, but is today a standalone game using "
"the Unreal Tournament engine. Luckily, this makes it playable under "
"GNU/Linux. Support for this is rather good (see "
"http://www.icculus.org/~ravage/tacops/), but systems that use glibc 2.3.x "
"(for which the Linux installer and updaters were not compiled) will run into "
"problems with the straightforward approach described on the previously "
"mentioned page. I thought I'd explain a quick and easy way to get it "
"working.  If you don't know what TacOps is, check out "
"http://www.tactical-ops.to - it is a great game."

"The problem: The installer needs Wine to unpack certain files, and comes "
"with a precompiled Wine for this purpose. The problem is that this Wine is "
"linked to an older glibc, and will not work with glibc 2.3.x. The problem is "
"described at http://icculus.org/~ravage/tacticalops/faq.html where a "
"solution is also presented. However, this solution did not work for me. If "
"it works for you, then you don't need to read on."

"I. Installing Wine:\n"
"  1) \tWe need a Wine linked against our own glibc. If you do not already "
"have\n"
"\tWine installed, compile and install it now. Follow the documentation at\n"
"\thttp://winehq.org or the Wine hint if you are in doubt about what to do.\n"
"  2)\tMake sure root has a working Wine configuration. As root, try:\n"
"  \t wine notepad\n"
"\tIf you get an error message about /root/.wine not being available, you\n"
"\tneed to set up a working Wine configuration for root. This is described\n"
"\tin the good documentation provided at http://winehq.org.\n"

"II. Downloading, fixing and running the installer:\n"
"  1) \tFirst, you will obviously need the TacOps Linux installer. Get it "
"at\n"
"\thttp://icculus.org/~ravage/tacticalops/files/tacticalops-3.1.5-install\n"
"\t-x86.run (one line).\n"
"  2)\tMount the TacOps CD wherever you wish, e.g:\n"
"  \t mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom\n"
"  3)\tExtract the files from the installer:\n"
"  \t sh ./tacticalops-3.1.5-install-x86.run --keep\n"
"\tThe installer will fail right away with a pretty segfault if X is not\n"
"\tavailable, but not to worry, the contents of the intaller is now\n"
"\tavailable to us (hence the --keep option). If X is available, the\n"
"\tinstaller will start - just exit it.\n"
"  4)\tEnter the directory created by the command in the previous step:\n"
"  \t cd tacticalops-3.1.5-install\n"
"\tFrom here on, you have two options; your choice will depend on\n"
"\twhether X is available for the installation or not. The \"b\" option is\n"
"\tuntested by me, and is only for those who do not have X available\n"
"\tduring the install. If you're going to follow the \"b\" option, you "
"still\n"
"\tneed to do step 5. If you are a newbee, it is preferable not to follow\n"
"\tthe \"b\" option.\n"
"  5)\tThis is where this hint and the FAQ differ. Why? Simply because the\n"
"  \tFAQ's way didn't work for me. I might have done stuff the wrong way,\n"
"\tbut hey...\n"
"  \tEnter the Wine directory in the dir created by the installer in step "
"3:\n"
"  \t cd wine\n"
"\tNow, for each of the binary files here, locate your system-wide Wine's\n"
"\tequivalent. Not all files are available system-wide, but the ones that\n"
"\tare, you delete from the installer's wine dir and replace with symlinks\n"
"\tto their system-wide equivalents. At least \"wine\" and \"wineserver\"\n"
"\tshould be available, or something is severely wrong with your Wine\n"
"\tinstallation.\n"
"\tThe installer will now use your system-wide Wine, linked against\n"
"\tyour glibc, which is what we want.\n"
"  5b)\t__Only if X is not available during the install! UNTESTED!__\n"
"  \tThe console installer itself, unlike the graphical installer, needs\n"
"\tpatching to work with glibc 2.3 as well. Enter the console installer's\n"
"\tdirectory and remove the installer:\n"
"\t cd setup.data/bin/Linux/x86\n"
"\t rm setup\n"
"\tDownload a working (hopefully) console installer to that directory, and\n"
"\tmake it executable:\n"
"\t wget http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/setup-RH9/setup\n"
"\t chmod 755 setup\n"
"\tLet's hope it works... If not, try the regular way, using the X-based\n"
"\tinstaller. I'd appreciate feedback on this, by the way.\n"
"  6)\tIf you did not follow the \"b\" option, make sure X is available to "
"the\n"
"  \tinstaller - this is vital! In the top level directory of the\n"
"\ttacticalops-3.1.5-install dir, run the installer:\n"
"\t SETUP_CDROM=/path/to/cd ./setup.sh\n"
"\tInstall the game. If you see errors regarding the extraction of the\n"
"\tfiles then Wine is not doing its thing correctly, or you didn't properly\n"
"\tmount the CD, or the CD is damaged.\n"

"III. Downloading the patches and patching the game:\n"
"  1)\tDid you think you were done? Oh no! We're now moving into territory\n"
"  \twhich, at the time of writing, was not covered by the Icculus FAQ.\n"
"\tYou may delete the directory created in step II.3.\n"
"\tDownload each and every Linux patch for the game, from 3.3.2 and up to\n"
"\tthe latest one. At the time of writing, you would be getting these\n"
"\tpatches:\n"
"\thttp://icculus.org/~ravage/tacticalops/files/tacticalops-3.3.2-x86.run\n"
"\thttp://icculus.org/~ravage/tacticalops/files/tacticalops-3.4.0-x86.run\n"
"  2)\tThe patches too need to some patching to work with glibc 2.3.x. They\n"
"  \tdo not need Wine though.\n"
"\tExtract the contents of the first patch (not inside the TacOps dir):\n"
"\t sh ./tacticalops-3.3.2-x86.run --keep\n"
"\tThe patch will segfault \"nicely\". Enter the dir left by the patch:\n"
"\t cd tacticalops-3.3.2\n"
"\tEnter the subdirectory in which the patcher program is located:\n"
"\t cd bin/Linux/x86\n"
"\tRemove the glibc 2.3 incompatible patcher:\n"
"\t rm loki_patch\n"
"\tDownload the glibc 2.3 compatible patcher:\n"
"\t wget http://gspr.dyndns.org/~gspr/lfs-hints/files/loki_patch\n"
"\t(It would be very nice if someone could mirror this, as my connection is\n"
"\tnot too fast, and the site from which I got the file is even slower).\n"
"\tMake it executable:\n"
"\t chmod 755 loki_patch\n"
"  3)\tReturn to the top level directory (tacticalops-3.3.2) and run:\n"
"  \t ./update.sh\n"
"\tIt should patch your game nicely.\n"
"  4)\tRepeat step 2 and 3 for each patch up the chain. You must make sure "
"to\n"
"  \tapply every patch in the chain.\n"
"  5)\tRun the game. It damn well better work.\n"
