"HINT: Perrin Aybara <vze24938@verizon.net> asked this question: \"Okay, this "
"is strange.  When I try to run something graphical as root (for example, my "
"latest case-in-point: installing realplayer 7), I get this: Xlib: connection "
"to \":0.0\" refused by server Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to "
"server Error: Can't open display: :0.0"

"I got this trying to install Real Player 7, I got this when compiling the "
"Glade-Perl module (in the \"make test\" phase it pops up a graphical UI you "
"can test out), and I remember getting it a couple other times too (I didn't "
"take much notice though, didn't matter at the time for whatever reason).  "
"I'm running XFree86 4.0.2 as a normal user (not root), and I'm attempting "
"the aforementioned commands as root from an Xterm.  I was always able to do "
"such things before, so this is very strange for me now.  Thanks in "
"advance...\""

"The main problem here is that root can't connect to the X server while it is "
"in use by another user. This happens fairly often, while installing software "
"for example. Andy <atark@thepipeline.net> replied with this information: "
"\"Try \"xhost +\" as the user that started X first, that should do it.  You "
"could also try \"export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0\" as root.\""

"The \"xhost +\" command permits to everyone to run programs on :0.0. This "
"includes root. And this includes every other user too. So, if you see "
"programs popping up, maybe someone logged in is trying to harass you, you "
"may just turn it off using the \"xhost -\" command. To restrict the command "
"to only the root user, use \"xhost root\". The DISPLAY environment variable "
"is used to determine which display to use when starting an X program."

"For my part, I've run into this problem sometimes, but on rare occasions, "
"and I can't reproduce it. Normally, root can use every display he wishes, "
"and no user can stop him. I've tried shutting down everyone's access to my "
"display, but root could still use it. Bottom point is: this problem happens, "
"this is the solution."
