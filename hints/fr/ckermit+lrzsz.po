"HINT: The first thing I tried to do when I installed my first linux, was to "
"connect my brand new HP48 (rather old now). After a couple of hours I found "
"C-Kermit, which I already knew from DOS. In my opinion this is the best "
"kermit server/client application there is out there. It's free but sadly not "
"released under the GPL.  I know I could use gkermit, since I'm already using "
"lrzsz, but if you wish to build your very own LFS, you'll choose the best, "
"right? lrzsz is X/Y/Zmodem communication program built from the "
"public-domain version of Chuck Forsberg's rzsz package and it's released "
"under the GPL."

"I wrote this hint to help people to install the packages needed to connect "
"their HP48/49 calculators but of course it could be use to connect two "
"computers with a null-modem cable. Also, C-Kermit is not just a file "
"transfer program, it's a modem program, telnet/ftp/http/X.25 client, and "
"server, can accept incoming dialed and network connections, etc. It's a very "
"powerfull application, by the way, I'm not from Columbia University. ;)"
