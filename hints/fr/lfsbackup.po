msgid ""
"Once you have finished building an LFS system, it might be a good idea to "
"create a backup of the new system, before continuing with BLFS and other "
"projects. In doing so, you can confidently experiment with your new system "
"and not \"buy the farm\" if things go terribly wrong.  A good time to do "
"this is right at the end of the LFS book, and before moving on to BLFS.  "
"This hint will explain how to create a dual-boot LFS system, using a "
"finished LFS system as a model, without doing another install."

"If you followed the LFS book, your host system (the one you built LFS "
"from),\n"
"will still be available in lilo. You may, however, have gotten rid of that\n"
"puppy just as soon as you logged into LFS without errors. There are "
"creative\n"
"ways to get around the fact that you may not have access to your original "
"host\n"
"system (the one you built LFS from). You can use the LFS boot CD, or a "
"boot\n"
"floppy with the necessary tools (post to lfs-support for the url to the "
"CD,\n"
" see other hints for making boot floppies).\n"

"Finally, unpartitioned drive space canbe on _any_ installed fixed drive.  "
"You can even install a drive from another (identical) system, make this "
"backup, re-install the drive in the original system, and you have two LFS "
"systems for the price of one! (to do this, you would ignore the editing of "
"fstab, and you would need to use a boot-disk to run lilo and make the system "
"bootable)"

"Note: If you are doing this at the end of the LFS book, or after any other "

"files like lfs-sources.tar. You may also want to run the --strip script at "
"the end of the book (4.0). This is not necessary, and if you are "
"uncomfortable deleting files or running the script, then don't! It will only "
"make your backup (considerably)  smaller and the process much faster."
