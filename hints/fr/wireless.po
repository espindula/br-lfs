"This is a Hint explaining how to prepare a PC for wireless communication "
"with the Internet and how to put it into operation. I solved this problem "
"with the help of hints and advices given by many persons, and working "
"through lots of papers, many of them not beeing actual anymore at this "
"time.  The object I had to deal with is an 'Acer' TravelMate 291LCi with "
"Intel Centrino Mobile Technology, equiped with an Intel PRO/Wireless "
"2200BG(IEEE 802.11b/g)  chip. The Laptop communicates with an 54 Mbps "
"Wireless Netgear ADSL Firewall Router DG834G as access point However, there "
"are good chances, that this hint may also be applied to other PC's with "
"other drivers. If you cannot obtain a native Linux driver for your wireless "
"NIC, you may want to try 'ndiswrapper', a package that will allow to load a "
"Windows driver under Linux."
