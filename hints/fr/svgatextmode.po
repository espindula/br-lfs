"only a small fraction of the console modes that most video hardware can "
"handle.  The SVGATextMode utility gives you access to the full range of "
"console modes that your hardware can support.  If you've been wanting a "
"console with 50 lines of 132 characters, this is the place to look."

"The default console mode set by the Linux kernel is 25 lines of 80 "
"characters.  That's fine if you're not doing much at the console, or if you "
"use a console window from X where you can make the window as big as you "
"like.  But if you're doing a lot of work at the console, 80x25 just isn't "
"big enough! 80x25 is an EGA mode selected by the kernel because all common "
"PC hardware supports it.  But most video cards and monitors these days are "
"capable of much higher resolutions simply by reprogramming the registers on "
"your VGA card.  What would you say to 50 lines of 132 characters each?"

"II. Text mode or graphics mode?\n"

#. type: Plain text
#: origin/svgatextmode.txt:54
msgid ""
"The Linux kernel itself provides two different ways to specify text modes "
"larger than 80x25.  The first is the video mode selection support that is "
"documented in the svga.txt file found in the kernel source's Documentation "
"directory.  With this support, you can specify any of the standard and "
"extended VGA text modes, and also (if you're fortunate) some custom modes.  "
"The problem is that the kernel's automatic detection of video cards is not "
"terribly reliable."

#. type: Plain text
#: origin/svgatextmode.txt:60
msgid ""
"Current Linux kernel versions also include framebuffer support, which will "
"give you a high-resolution console provided you enable framebuffer support "
"in your kernel configuration.  Although it's a nice feature, using "
"framebuffer puts your video card into graphics mode, resulting in very slow "
"scrolling.  On an older, slower computer, a graphics mode console is "
"unbearable."

"SVGATextMode is a program that supports a wide range of video cards and chip "
"sets.  You specify your video card and the capabilities of your monitor in "
"an X-like configuration file, and then run the program telling it what text "
"mode to display.  SVGATextMode talks directly to the hardware, rather than "
"to the BIOS, to set the video mode.  Specifying your video card and monitor "
"capabilities helps prevent SVGATextMode from trying to change into a mode "
"that will damage the video card or the monitor."

"The configuration file also contains descriptions of many different text "
"modes that you can try.  Some you probably won't be able to use due to "
"hardware limitations, and others are just plain ugly.  But you should be "
"able to find several high-resolution modes that will improve on the standard "
"80x25 and other modes supported directly by the kernel."
