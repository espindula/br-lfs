"(1) Introduction: crablfs: User Based Package Management System which is "
"written in python. Every package and its files belong to a system normal "
"user, and a batch script to rebuild or migrate your personalized LFS/BLFS "
"system by install all your packages automatically all at once. The goal of "

"The basic theory is: every package in the system has a corresponding user it "
"belongs to, the installation actions(copy, mkdir, etc) will run by this "
"user, thus all the files a package generated have the mode of this user. At "
"the same time, all those users belongs to a 'install' group, and the key "
"directories in the system such as /usr/local, /usr/local/bin, etc have "
"g+s,o+t mode, and owned to the 'install' group, to make different packages "
"create their own files and directories in those directories."
