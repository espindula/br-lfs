"At this point you have two decisions to make.\n"
"The first is whether or not you want to install the utils that come with \n"
"fortune. These are not required and you probably won't want to use them.\n"
"Secondly, you need to decide whether or not you want to install the "
"offensive\n"
"quotes. Offensive counts as: (taken from \"Offensive\" file)\n"
"\tAnything about sex is offensive.  Welcome to America.  *sigh*\n"
"        Insults based on religion or ethnicity are offensive.\n"
"\tGenerally, any criticism of anybody's religion is offensive.\n"
"\t\"He really said that?\" quotes from politicians are offensive.\n"
"\tPolitical bias is offensive.\n"
"\tLimericks are offensive even if they aren't.\n"
"\tTastelessness is offensive (q.v. \"The Snack\").\n"
"\tMisogyny and misandry for the sake of themselves are offensive.\n"
"\tVulgarity is offensive.\n"
"        Violence for the sake of humor is offensive.\n"
"It is entirely up to you if you install the offensive quotes or not. I "
"choose\n"
"not to, because I run a multiuser, family system.\n"
