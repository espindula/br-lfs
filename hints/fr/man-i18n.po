msgid ""
"The most frequently occurring internationalization-related problem is when "
"some character data are encoded not in the same way as expected. E.g., this "
"happens when a string in the CP1251 encoding is sent to a terminal that "
"expects KOI8-R.  Let's investigate that process in more detail. A "
"misbehaving application wants to send \"Cyrillic Small Letter Em\". Since "
"this letter is encoded with the 0xec byte in CP1251, the application sends "
"that byte to the terminal. However, the terminal assumes KOI8-R, and "
"interprets the incoming 0xec byte according to that encoding, in which it "
"means \"Cyrillic Capital Letter El\", and happily prints that letter. All "
"subsequent Cyrillic letters are mangled in the similar way. The result is "
"not readable by any language specialist -- it's whfg pbeehcgrq (go figure "
"out what this means -- a user will instead just call devil, deity, the local "
"admin or whoever is responsible for this mess). It's much worse than seeing "
"untranslated English messages."
