"I have a small local network using djbdns. Caching and reverse resolution "

"would be trouble distributing them. I am working on this, and a future "
"version of this hint will include a script to make these tarballs. (DJB "
"wants the modification dates to remain intact so it is easy to recognize old "
"documentation. My script modifies some of the hyperlinks to point back to "
"his site instead of non-existant files on the local machine. This changes "
"the dates and so would break the terms of distribution.) A future version of "
"this hint will contain a script to prepare these documentation tarballs."

"You could use BIND. I had difficulty compiling it, had real trouble "
"understanding how it was configured, and I did not like the frequency of "
"security patches for it. It is possible to reduce the chances of intrusion "
"by running bind in a chroot environment. Have fun working out how to do "
"that. BIND also has some exciting ideas about allowing spoofing."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: origin/djbdns.txt:61
msgid ""
"There are several dns programs in djbdns. They are picky about which "
"external servers they use to reduce the ease of spoofing.  They all run "
"chrooted. They are all set for high availability - if one crashes, it will "
"be restarted (at a limited rate to prevent some DOS attacks). There is a "
"prize for the first person to publicly report a verifiable security hole in "
"the latest version of djbdns."

"The djbdns package contains several types of dns server. If you are doing "
