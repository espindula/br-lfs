"DESCRIPTION: This hint describes how I installed Zero Install on my newly "
"created Linux From Scratch 5.0 system. Zero Install seems like a very good "
"way of (not :)) installing and using software that has been \"packaged\" by "
"its developers, thus eliminating the need for centralized packaging of "
"software like Debian and Red Hat have been doing. This hint should be "
"suitable for anyone who has built himself a LFS system."

"PREREQUISITES: I installed Zero Install on a Linux From Scratch 5.0 "

"able to use a later version of LFS for this hint."
