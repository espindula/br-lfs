"DESCRIPTION: This is an index to all the packages that make up\n"
"[1]Linux from Scratch (LFS). Under each package we list, in this\n"
"order:\n"
" 1. The homepage for the package, or the [2]freshmeat.net page if\n"
" there isn't a homepage we know about.\n"
" 2. The URL of the manual, possibly the man page, but something to let\n"
" you learn what the package does and how to use it. There are a few\n"
" packages where we either have nothing yet to tell you here, or the\n"
" homepage is the best reference for manuals that we know.\n"
" 3. Optionally, the URL's of interesting and informative material that\n"
" may help you understand the package better, use it for some common\n"
" task, or be otherwise educational.\n"
