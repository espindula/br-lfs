"HINT: Earth is divided in 24 time zones. The local time in a zone depends on "
"how many zones it is away from Greenwich, Great Britain. The difference in "
"time is relative to the 0 zone over Greenwich. For example, in Indiana, USA "
"(where I live) we're in the -5 zone. That means, it's five hours earlier "
"here than in Great Britain. This compensates for the world turning."

"   The hardware clock is the clock that ticks in your BIOS and keeps the "
"time\n"
"even if the system is powered off. However, the hardware clock is not all "
"that\n"
"precise. The system clock is the time that the kernel maintains while it's\n"
"running and it is considerably more precise. But how does the system clock "
"know\n"
"what time it is? During boot up, the standard LFS boot scripts set the "
"system\n"
"clock from the hardware clock. After that, the hardware clock is "
"ignored. The\n"
"problem with this scenario is that after many days of uptime (depending on "
"the\n"
"accuracy of your BIOS), there could be a rather large discrepancy between "
"the\n"
"system clock and the hardware clock. When you reboot, the still inaccurate\n"
"hardware clock will be used to set the system clock. Therefore, it would\n"
"behoove us to allow the kernel to update the BIOS time at shutdown so that "
"the\n"
"BIOS will be more likely to have an accurate time when the system boots up "
"the\n"
"next time. Reading from and writing to the hardware clock is done by a "
"program\n"
"named hwclock(8). This program is part of a normal LFS system, so you "
