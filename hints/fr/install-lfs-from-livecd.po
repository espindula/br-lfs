"SYNOPSIS: How to build a LFS 6.1 system using the LFS live CD as your host "
"OS."

#: origin/install-lfs-from-livecd.txt:17
msgid ""
"DESCRIPTION: This hint should guide you through the process of building a "
"LFS system using the LFS live CD as the host operating system.  You use the "
"LFS live CD to boot the computer instead of loading a pre- packaged linux "
"distribution like Debian or Red Hat.  This is the \"cleanest\" way to build "
"a LFS system, since inconsistancies and idiosyncracies of the various "
"distributions are removed."

"PREREQUISITES:\n"
"The prerequisists are the same as that of LFS.  You will also need to\n"
"have the LFS live CD for the version of LFS that you intend to build.\n"
" I also assume that you know how to create and edit a text file with\n"
"an editor, rather than using redirected cat or echo commands.  This\n"
"is not a hint on using the live CD, so any problems you encounter\n"
"using or booting your system with the live CD should be directed to\n"
"the LFS live CD mailing list.\n"

"This hint was written for LFS 6.1.  Due to the rapidly changing nature of "
"linux, some of the scripts describe herein may break in future versions of "
"LFS.  If you understand what the scripts are doing and why, it should not be "
"very difficult to adapt the scripts to match future versions of LFS."

"HINT: It was suggested that this hint could be reduced to \"follow the "
"book\".  Well, almost.  You could also use the ALFS profiles which are "
"included on the Live CD.  But that is not the point.  This hint points out "
"the difference of building LFS when booted up from a \"Live CD\", "
"specifically the LFS Live CD, as opposed to a pre-installed linux "
"distribution.  This hint also provides a couple of scripts that will make "
"your job easier."

"Although not specific to this hint, I do want to point out the following "
"since I assume that most people who will be reading this are building LFS "
"for the first time: When following the LFS book note the difference between "
"the \"back-tick\" [ ` ] and the single quote [ ' ].  On a US keyboard the "
"back-tick is on the key with the [ ~ ] and the single-quote is on the key "
"with the [ \" ].  Also, capitalization matters.  If you specify a configure "
"or make option in the wrong case, you may not get any warning and the build "
"may fail or exhibit problems later.  A wrong charater is a \"sed\" command "
"can trash files.  Think about what each command does before you hit the "
"enter key.  If you don't understand what is happening, look it up using the "
"man pages.  I learned more about Linux in general by building my first LFS "
"system then I did in several years of administering a popular distribution."
