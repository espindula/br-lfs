"DESCRIPTION: Lots of obscure software is required to build the Linux kernel "
"documentation into man, html, ps, or pdf format.  This hint provides "
"instruction as to which packages are needed, how to install them, and how to "
"modify the kernel Makefiles in order to build properly.  Probably only "
"people doing system level programming, or kernel programming will need these "
"docs."

"PREREQUISITES: Docbook DSSSL stylesheets, SGML DTDs, and TeTeX 2.0.2 must be "

"addition, a kernel source tree is required, and recommended that it be from "
"http://www.kernel.org.  This hint refers to 2.4.18 and 2.6.0-test8."

"Building the kernel does not require software beyond a base development "
"workstation (see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org).  On the other hand, "
"building the kernel documentation requires that you install various "
"typesetting and parser programs.  Additionally, the kernel documentation may "
"be, at times, broken! Broken documentation can be easily fixed with a plain "
"text editor and no prior knowledge of SGML (what is SGML anyway)."
