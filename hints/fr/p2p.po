"A bit of history: The first succesful P2P network was Napster. By sharing "
"music the program attracted millions of users. It wasn't used for much legal "
"content though, which is why it got shut down. Basically, Napster worked by "
"connecting people's clients to each other via servers. The servers were "
"comparable to catalogues and were used to store the information of what each "
"client offered.  More recent P2P networks use a decentralized approach to "
"filesharing. The most popular variants nowadays are the Fasttrack network, "
"used by Kazaa, and the eDonkey network. The eDonkey protocol (and the "
"popularized implementation of eMule) has the following features:"

"On http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html you find several "
"eDonkey links. These can be used to download the LFS packages tarball via an "
"eDonkey client. Lucky for us, the protocol has several fully-functional open "
"source implementations (xmule, amule, emule, mldonkey). You can also use the "
"official implementation (edonkey and overnet), although it has little "
"advantages over the others and is only available as binary (big no-no for "
"LFS'ers). I'll only explain how to install and use mlDonkey though, since "
"that is what I have actual experience with. If people are willing to "

"About eDonkey: eDonkey works with queues: if you start a download, you'll "
"get placed in the queue of everyone who shares that package. Downloading "
"costs you points while uploading gains you points so you are rewarded for "
"sharing. Whatever you download gets automatically shared.  Some rules of "
"thumb to keep in mind: 1. you probably want to regulate how much bandwidth "
"your client can use, and 2. the longer your client runs, the faster your "
"downloads will go. In the beginning, they'll be slow. I recommend letting it "
"run as long as you can afford your computer to be online (mine is 24x7).  "
"3. the more people who share a certain file, the faster your download will "
"go."
