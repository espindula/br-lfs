"DESCRIPTION: pio is a \"timestamper\" package manager found useful for "
"(B)LFS installations.  It is run once before installation to \"take "
"inventory\" of defined directories, then again after installation.  It "
"observes new/changed subdirectories and files, and builds a script which "
"will safely remove whatever was installed.  This \"removal\" script is the "
"basis for other tricks it will do."

"Above all, pio is a dis-integrated package manager.  It's simply a hands-on "
"tool to be used.  It enforces nothing!"

"PREREQUISITES: pio is entirely bash script, almost 1100 lines of it.  One "
"must understand bash to \"extend\" it or do \"maintenance\".  Have a care; "
"pio makes scripts that WILL remove files! But being bash script, it can be "
"\"easily\" maintained or extended."

"HINT: Once upon a time there was git, the Guarded Installation Tool, by Ingo "
"Brueckl (ib@wupperonline.de) 14.11.1996.  I found it useful for LFS builds & "
"added a few functions.  Then Linus made a kernel development management tool "
"he chose to call git.  So I changed this script to avoid potential "
"confusion.  pio is still almost entirely Ingo's git.  Some functionality has "
"been changed.  That's my responsibility."
