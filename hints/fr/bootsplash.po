"DESCRIPTION: This hint describes how to create your own graphical boot using "
"bootsplash.  Bootsplash is a packages that allows you to display background "
"pictures with or without animations on your consoles, during kernel boot and "
"during init. It's fully themeable and it uses the framebuffer. Hence it "
"works with kernel 2.4 as well as 2.6 and you can use hardware graphics "
"acceleration."

"PREREQUISITES: This hint was tested on LFS-5.1.1/kernel-2.6.8.1 and "
"LFS-6.0/kernel-2.6.11.7.  These combinations are tested, but others will "
"probably work too. Just get the patch that matches your kernel version.  The "
"bootsplash package requires that libmng is installed. See the BLFS book for "
"libmng build instructions."
