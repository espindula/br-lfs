"This hint describes backups which allow you to recover from accidental "

"themselves contain any means to boot. Both a \"full\" and \"incremental\" or "
"\"differential\" style of backup can be created, but a separate boot medium "
"must be supplied by the LFS user. The hint covers what needs to be backed "

"The first consideration in any backup, is that it actually represents a "

"one which appears to have taken place in an instant. The only way absolutely "
"to guarantee this, is for all file systems to be in a consistent state, and "
"for them not to be modified for the duration of the backup. More than one "
"technique for accomplishing that have been suggested, but the simplest to "
"achieve with an LFS system is simply to reboot to single user mode. How this "
"is accomplished depends upon what you chose as your boot method, so the "
"details of that can't be covered in full here. However, if you use GRUB, as "
"suggested in the LFS book, then you can create an entry for single user mode "
