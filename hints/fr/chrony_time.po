"Chrony is a software package for maintaining the accuracy of computer system "
"clocks. It consists of a pair of programs: chronyd is a daemon running in "
"the background and chronyc is a command line control and monitoring program."

"This hint describes the use of chrony to keep the system clock on a single "

"chrony.txt file referenced below also describes how to use chrony on systems "
