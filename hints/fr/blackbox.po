"\t\"Blackbox is that fast, light window manager you have been looking for\n"
"\t without all those annoying library dependencies. If you have a C++ \n"
"\t compiler and the X Window system you can compile and use it.\"\n"
"So there you have it. There really are no dependencies except those that "
"you\n"
"get when you create a LFS system and the XFree86 dependency which is just\n"
"common sense.\n"

"The installation for Blackbox is quite simple. It's just like all the other "
