"SYNOPSIS: Apcupsd power protection for your LFS connected to an APC UPS via "
"serial port.    \n"

msgid ""
"DESCRIPTION: This hint describes the installation of Apcupsd software on an "
"LFS based computer protected by an American Power Conversion (APC) "
"uinterruptible power supply connected via serial cable.  The normal software "
"installation analyzes the sytem to determine a standard linux distribution "
"so that scripts may be installed to their proper place. Because LFS is "
"nonstandard the installation is not completed and left to the user.  This "
"hint describes the steps needed to complete the software installation on an "
"LFS system."

#. type: Plain text

"PREREQUISITES: This hint will work on any LFS system although the "
"bootscripts may need minor modifications.  This is especially true of older "
"LFS systems where the bootscripts were NOT in the /etc/rc.d/init.d "
"directory."

"Apcupsd is useful for controlling American Power Conversion's (APC)  "
"uninterruptiple power supplies (UPS).  Apcupsd monitors the UPS and during a "
"power loss, informs the system users of the failure, and if power is not "
"restored, safely shuts down the system.  The Apcupsd manual (available on "
"line at http://www.sibbald.com/apcupsd/manual/index.html or with the "
"software)  provides excellent instructions on installing and configuring the "
"software.  The configure script can identify several standard linux "
"distributions and make the correct installation. However, as LFS is by "
"design not standard this hint provides the information to protect an LFS "
"system with an APC UPS connected via a serial connection using Apcupsd "
"software."
