"Earlier I wrote a hint about this using PAM, with the help of the module "
"pam_script. I discovered that PAM is not the best place to do so. PAM is not "
"the place to start scripts, KDM is. KDM provides a very easy way via the "
"Xstartup and Xreset files to execute scripts. PAM has the abilty to do "
"something with the credentials provided at login, with the help of a module "
"called pam_script."
