"SYNOPSIS: Using raw photos to get a wider range of highlight and shadow "
"detail, in a manner somewhat similar to creating HDR photos, but with 8-bit "
"(jpeg) results, and using a comparatively-simple approach."

"DESCRIPTION: This guide provides suggestions for using raw photos in the "
"gimp (2.8) with ufraw so that on-screen jpegs can show more detail, but "
"without the intricacies of hand-painting masks. The techniques were tested "
"with pictures of trains, where much detail is often hidden in deep shadow, "
"but may be useful to people who photograph scenery, buildings, and other "
"similar subjects, or (untested) for photos of people in bright sunshine. The "
"approach here is comparatively quick per photo - real photographers can "
"afford to spend a couple of hours on a picture, but when I have maybe 50 "
"pictures per day, all of which I want to try to put online, and a couple of "
"weeks' worth of pictures, such an approach is not going to work for me."

"Unlike \"true\" HDR photography (multiple exposures, the camera has to be on "

"I got a camera with the ability to take raw images in the early 2000s.  At "
"that time I found ufraw, and used that to adjust some pictures. In late 2007 "
"I renewed my interest in trains, and model railways, and started visiting "
"various lines and taking pictures that I hoped might be useful to other "
"modellers. In the days of real film you could get hand prints, for a price, "
"with improved detail - the Dodge and Burn tools in the gimp replicate this "

"Change the suffix to .jpg from the default .png if this is the first export "
"in this session. I like to make the name whatever-90.jpeg so that if the "
"name matches the camera's name it will NOT overwrite the camera's own "
"jpg. For a jpeg, the next box allows you to set the quality, with a default "
"of 90. A quality of 90 (%) seems to be adequate, at least on my 20\" screen "
"or on A4 prints."
