"Gatling, by Felix von Leitner, is small, superfast and is very easy to set "
"up.  For the arguments for and against, see the website "
"http://www.fefe.de/gatling. Gatling is built using the dietlibc and libowfat "
"libraries, which we will also build. The executable is statically linked and "
"about 120 Kbytes in size (i686 gcc-4)."
