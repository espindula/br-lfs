"A newbie, having just finished building his LFS system, doesn't realize just "
"how much he doesn't know. The knowledge involved in building a Linux system "
"from scratch is advanced, but when you reduce the procedure to executing "
"blindly commands, that knowledge is lost. I'm not saying that having a "
"perfect LFS book that can be followed blindly is bad, because it sure isn't "

"for support on lfs-dev).  You're goal is not just to have a great system, it "

"A common assumption is that there are configuration programs everywhere that "
"you must run to customize your system. Well, stop looking for *cfg*, these "
"are very scarce, and often they don't do the job very well. The major part "
"of those configuration programs only edit or create a configuration file for "
"you. They are not the configuration itself. For example, to setup the X "
"Window System, there is the \"xf86cfg\" program available to help you. This "
"programs asks you a few questions, and then writes a configuration file "
"based on your choices.  Because an option is not in \"xf86cfg\" does not "
"mean that it is not available. To successfully configure programs, you must "
"edit the configuration file. Fiddling with configuration programs is a bad "
"habit, as it will seldom work and will often give not optimal "
"configurations."

"There are a few exceptions to this trend. For example, the \"iptables\" "
"(\"ipchains\" for 2.2.x kernels) program is used to configure the firewall "
"features of the kernel. To configure a firewall, you must run the "
"\"iptables\" program at every bootup, with the desired options. The "
"\"ifconfig\" program is another good example. It is the \"winipcfg\" of "
"Linux. It is used to setup Ethernet adapters, modems and all other sorts of "
"network interfaces. In general, programs are only used to configure kernel "
"options, and they must be run at every bootup. The kernel doesn't remember "
"anything."

"Another thing that newbies must relearn is the use of the command line. It "
"will never go away. Even if you install a desktop environment like GNOME and "
"KDE, you will use the command line often. You will eventually find it faster "
"to invoke programs using the command line than by clicking on an icon. Also, "
"don't assume that because something doesn't work in GUI means it doesn't "
"work at all. Often, it's the link between command line and GUI that is "
"broken. Try the command in a terminal, and see if it works."

"In Linux, especially less dumbed down variants such as Debian and, of "
"course, LFS, the GUI is built on top of the core OS, and is not actually the "
"OS itself.  As a newbie, your goal should not be to get away from the "
"command line as fast as possible and then install a desktop environment. You "
"must gain competence at the CLI first and foremost; LFS is about gaining "
"mastery of your system, not having your system master you. After you can "
"work on the command line comfortably, then you'll have gained mastery over "
"any GUI."

"A general tip: never assume that because you know how to do something in "
"windows it will be done in a similar way in Linux. They are two completely "
"different operating systems, and deal with things completely "
"differently. For example, many newbies see a command somewhere, and try to "
"execute it by typing its name, as they would have done in DOS. Being in the "
"directory containing the command isn't a guarantee that it will work. The "
"PATH variable contains all the directories searched for executables, as in "
"DOS. But the difference is that the current directory (\".\") isn't included "
"by default (and shouldn't be). Imagine if a user creates a \"ls\" file in "
"their home directory containing a script that erases the whole hard "
"drive. The user tells the root user about a problem in his root "
"directory. The sysadmin goes into the home directory, executes \"ls\" and "
"must now reinstall the whole system. See the bash man page for more info "
"concerning the PATH variable."

"Another thing: do not suffer from the \"I'll reinstall, it'll probably work "
"this time\" syndrom. I know of only one program that is solved by this "
"tactic, and it is koffice, and I just learned about it today. Normally, it "
"doesn't change anything to reinstall. Everything works the first time or "
"everything doesn't work the first time. Do not lose time building 20 LFS "
"systems, unless you're sure that building a new system is the only "
"solution. Also, the similar syndrom \"I'll reboot, it will probably work\" "
"is as damaging. You do NOT need to reboot in linux, except to load a new "
"kernel. And even that can be done without rebooting, if you wish to hack a "
"bit. Rebooting is a habit created by Windows.  You should never need to "
"reboot after having installed something."
