"HINT: I built my workstation with the 2.4 series kernel because I became "
"tired of following changes in the 2.6 series. It went fairly smoothly, and "
"this hint contains the modifications to the LFS and BLFS books that were "
"needed. There may be some things that I have overlooked, but my system with "
"Xorg-7.1, and everything else, seems to be working perfectly fine. If you "
"discover something I overlooked then please email me the difference. This "
"hint is based on LFS-SVN-20070209, but should work with any LFS book after "
"6.0."

"The host system can be running any of the Linux 2.6 kernels. If the host "
"system is running a Linux 2.4 kernel, then I suggest running a kernel newer "
"than 2.4.22 because Glibc uses additional kernel features until 2.4.22. Be "
"sure to enable CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS and CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS in the host kernel so "
"/dev/pts can be mounted."
