Since it can be easy to overlook one of the many little places where this
template file needs to be edited, I've tried to make it easier for editors to
quickly bash out an xml page by inserting a unique string in the template files
that can be sedded out in place of the package name.

In template.xml the unique string for is lowercase Lsad823
In template.xml the unique string for is uppercase w786etY

Now, let's say you want to create a page for LibPNG in general/. Simply:

sed -e 's|Lsad823|libpng|g' \
    -e 's|w786etY|LibPNG|g' template.xml > general/libpng.xml

Hopefully this will help speed things up a bit.
