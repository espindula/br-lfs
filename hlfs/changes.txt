# The '-N' patch option is removed, because it supports broken patches (see
# patch(1) manual page).

# Install info and manual pages to the object directory, so they're not
# installed to /tools, with --infodir=$(pwd)/DESTDIR --mandir=$(pwd)/DESTDIR,
# or with whatever works.

# Support native x86_32 and x86_64. No multilib, cross compiling, or emulation.
# Contact the mailing list if you want to help add support for more platforms.

# Added several small changes to the tools required to boot the temporary 
# system. These changes were made to e2fsprogs, sysvinit, udev, and 
# util-linux. Added booting_temporary directory and pages.
