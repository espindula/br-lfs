  <title>Stripping</title>

  <para>This section is optional.  If the intended user is not a
  programmer and does not plan to do
  any debugging on the system software, the system size can be decreased
  by about 2 GB by removing the debugging symbols from binaries and
  libraries. This causes no inconvenience other than not being able to
  debug the software fully anymore.</para>

  <para>Most people who use the commands mentioned below do not
  experience any difficulties. However, it is easy to make a typo and
  render the new system unusable, so before running the
  <command>strip</command> commands, it is a good idea to make a
  backup of the LFS system in its current state.</para>

  <para>The debugging symbols for selected libraries are placed
  in separate files.  This debugging information is needed if running
  regression tests that use <ulink
  url='&blfs-book;/general/valgrind.html'>valgrind</ulink> or <ulink
  url='&blfs-book;/general/gdb.html'>gdb</ulink> later in BLFS.
  </para>

  <para>Note that <command>strip</command> will overwrite the binary or library
  file it is processing.  This can crash the processes using code or data from
  the file.  If the process running <command>strip</command> itself is
  affected, the binary or library being stripped can be destroyed and can
  make the system completely unusable.  To avoid it, we'll copy some libraries
  and binaries into <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>, strip them
  there, and install them back with the <command>install</command> command.
  Read the related entry in <xref linkend="pkgmgmt-upgrade-issues"/> for the
  rationale to use the <command>install</command> command here.</para>

  <note><para>The ELF loader's name is ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 on 64-bit systems
  and ld-linux.so.2 on 32-bit systems.  The construct below selects the
  correct name for the current architecture, excluding anything ending
  with <quote>g</quote>, in case the commands below have already been
  run.</para></note>

<!-- also of interest are libgfortan, libgo, libgomp, and libobjc from GCC -->

  <para>A large number of files will be reported as having their file
  format not recognized. These warnings can be safely ignored. They
  indicate that those files are scripts instead of binaries.</para>
