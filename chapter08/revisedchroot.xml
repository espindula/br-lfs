  <title>Cleaning Up</title>

  <para>Finally, clean up some extra files left around from running tests:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /tmp/*</userinput></screen>

  <para>Now log out and reenter the chroot environment with an updated
  chroot command.  From now on, use this updated chroot command any time 
  you need to reenter the chroot environment after exiting:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>logout

chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i          \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM"            \
    PS1='(lfs chroot) \u:\w\$ '        \
    PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin            \
    /bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

  <para>Here the <parameter>+h</parameter> option is not used anymore, since
  all the previous programs have been replaced: hashing is therefore
  possible.</para>

  <para>If the virtual kernel file systems have been unmounted, either manually
  or through a reboot, ensure that the virtual kernel file systems are mounted
  when reentering the chroot. This process was explained in <xref
  linkend="ch-tools-bindmount"/> and <xref
  linkend="ch-tools-kernfsmount"/>.</para>

  <para>There are also several files installed in the /usr/lib and /usr/libexec
  directories with a file name extension of .la. These are "libtool archive"
  files. As already said, they are only useful when linking with static
  libraries. They are unneeded, and potentially harmful, when using dynamic
  shared libraries, specially when using also non-autotools build systems.
  To remove them, run:</para>

<screen><userinput>find /usr/lib /usr/libexec -name \*.la -delete</userinput></screen>

   <para>For more information about libtool archive files, see the <ulink
   url="&blfs-book;/introduction/la-files.html">BLFS section "About Libtool
   Archive (.la) files"</ulink>.</para>

   <para>The compiler built in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> and
   <xref linkend="chapter-chroot-temporary-tools"/> is still partially
   installed and not needed anymore. Remove it with:</para>

<screen><userinput>find /usr -depth -name $(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu\* | xargs rm -rf</userinput></screen>

   <para>Finally, remove the temporary 'tester' user account created at the 
   beginning of the previous chapter.</para>

<screen><userinput>userdel -r tester</userinput></screen>
