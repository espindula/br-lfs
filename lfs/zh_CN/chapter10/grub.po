"GRUB uses its own naming structure for drives and partitions in the form of "
"<emphasis>(hdn,m)</emphasis>, where <emphasis>n</emphasis> is the hard drive "
"number and <emphasis>m</emphasis> is the partition number. The hard drive "
"number starts from zero, but the partition number starts from one for normal "
"partitions and five for extended partitions.  Note that this is different "
"from earlier versions where both numbers started from zero. For example, "
"partition <filename class=\"partition\">sda1</filename> is "
"<emphasis>(hd0,1)</emphasis> to GRUB and <filename class=\"partition\">sdb3</"
"filename> is <emphasis>(hd1,3)</emphasis>. In contrast to Linux, GRUB does "
"not consider CD-ROM drives to be hard drives. For example, if using a CD on "
"<filename class=\"partition\">hdb</filename> and a second hard drive on "
"<filename class=\"partition\">hdc</filename>, that second hard drive would "
"still be <emphasis>(hd1)</emphasis>."

"The location of the boot partition is a choice of the user that affects the "
"configuration.  One recommendation is to have a separate small (suggested "
"size is 200 MB) partition just for boot information.  That way each build, "
"whether LFS or some commercial distro, can access the same boot files and "
"access can be made from any booted system.  If you choose to do this, you "
"will need to mount the separate partition, move all files in the current "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> directory (e.g. the linux "
"kernel you just built in the previous section) to the new partition.  You "
"will then need to unmount the partition and remount it as <filename class="
