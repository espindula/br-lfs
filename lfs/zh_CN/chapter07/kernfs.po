"The recommended method of populating the <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/dev</filename> directory with devices is to mount a "
"virtual filesystem (such as <systemitem "
"class=\"filesystem\">tmpfs</systemitem>) on the <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/dev</filename> directory, and allow the devices to be "
"created dynamically on that virtual filesystem as they are detected or "
"accessed. Device creation is generally done during the boot process by "
"Udev. Since this new system does not yet have Udev and has not yet been "
"booted, it is necessary to mount and populate <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/dev</filename> manually. This is accomplished by bind "
"mounting the host system's <filename class=\"directory\">/dev</filename> "
"directory. A bind mount is a special type of mount that allows you to create "
"a mirror of a directory or mount point to some other location. Use the "
"following command to achieve this:"
