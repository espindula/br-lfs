"The <parameter>-i</parameter> option given to the <command>env</command> "
"command will clear all variables of the chroot environment. After that, only "
"the <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>TERM</envar>, <envar>PS1</envar>, and "
"<envar>PATH</envar> variables are set again. The <parameter>TERM=$TERM</"
"parameter> construct will set the <envar>TERM</envar> variable inside chroot "
"to the same value as outside chroot. This variable is needed for programs "
"like <command>vim</command> and <command>less</command> to operate "
"properly.  If other variables are desired, such as <envar>CFLAGS</envar> or "
"<envar>CXXFLAGS</envar>, this is a good place to set them again."
