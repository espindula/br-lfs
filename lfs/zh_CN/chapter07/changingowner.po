"Currently, the whole directory hierarchy in <filename class=\"directory\">"
"$LFS</filename> is owned by the user <systemitem class=\"username\">lfs</"
"systemitem>, a user that exists only on the host system. If the directories "
"and files under <filename class=\"directory\">$LFS</filename> are kept as "
"they are, they will be owned by a user ID without a corresponding account. "
"This is dangerous because a user account created later could get this same "
"user ID and would own all the files under <filename class=\"directory\">"
"$LFS</filename>, thus exposing these files to possible malicious "
