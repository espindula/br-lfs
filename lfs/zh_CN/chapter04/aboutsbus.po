"Many people would like to know beforehand approximately how long it takes to "
"compile and install each package. Because Linux From Scratch can be built on "
"many different systems, it is impossible to provide accurate time estimates. "
"The biggest package (Glibc) will take approximately 20 minutes on the "
"fastest systems, but could take up to three days on slower systems! Instead "
"of providing actual times, the Standard Build Unit (SBU) measure will be "
"used instead."

"许多人想在编译和安装各个软件包之前，了解这一过程大概需要多少时间。由于 Linux From Scratch "

"而在一些较慢的系统上需要 3 天！因此，我们不提供实际时间，而是以标准构建单位 (SBU) 衡量时间。"
