"This section is optional.  If the intended user is not a programmer and does "
"not plan to do any debugging on the system software, the system size can be "
"decreased by about 2 GB by removing the debugging symbols from binaries and "
"libraries. This causes no inconvenience other than not being able to debug "
"the software fully anymore."

"Most people who use the commands mentioned below do not experience any "

"unusable, so before running the <command>strip</command> commands, it is a "
"good idea to make a backup of the LFS system in its current state."

"Note that <command>strip</command> will overwrite the binary or library file "
"it is processing.  This can crash the processes using code or data from the "
"file.  If the process running <command>strip</command> itself is affected, "
"the binary or library being stripped can be destroyed and can make the "
"system completely unusable.  To avoid it, we'll copy some libraries and "
"binaries into <filename class=\"directory\">/tmp</filename>, strip them "
"there, and install them back with the <command>install</command> command.  "
