"The installation of this software is straightforward. Although in many cases "
"the installation instructions could be made shorter and more generic, we "
"have opted to provide the full instructions for every package to minimize "
"the possibilities for mistakes.  The key to learning what makes a Linux "
"system work is to know what each package is used for and why you (or the "
"system)  may need it."

"We do not recommend using optimizations.  They can make a program run "
"slightly faster, but they may also cause compilation difficulties and "
"problems when running the program.  If a package refuses to compile when "
"using optimization, try to compile it without optimization and see if that "
"fixes the problem. Even if the package does compile when using optimization, "
"there is the risk it may have been compiled incorrectly because of the "
"complex interactions between the code and build tools.  Also note that the "
"<option>-march</option> and <option>-mtune</option> options using values not "
"specified in the book have not been tested. This may cause problems with the "
"toolchain packages (Binutils, GCC and Glibc).  The small potential gains "
"achieved in using compiler optimizations are often outweighed by the risks.  "
"First-time builders of LFS are encouraged to build without custom "
"optimizations. The subsequent system will still run very fast and be stable "
"at the same time."

"In general, the LFS editors discourage building and installing static "
"libraries.  The original purpose for most static libraries has been made "
"obsolete in a modern Linux system.  In addition, linking a static library "
"into a program can be detrimental.  If an update to the library is needed to "
"remove a security problem, all programs that use the static library will "
"need to be relinked to the new library.  Since the use of static libraries "
"is not always obvious, the relevant programs (and the procedures needed to "
"do the linking) may not even be known."

"In the procedures in this chapter, we remove or disable installation of most "
"static libraries. Usually this is done by passing a <option>--disable-"
"static</option> option to <command>configure</command>.  In other cases, "
"alternate means are needed. In a few cases, especially glibc and gcc, the "
"use of static libraries remains essential to the general package building "
