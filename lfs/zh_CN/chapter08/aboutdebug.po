"Most programs and libraries are, by default, compiled with debugging symbols "
"included (with <command>gcc</command>'s <parameter>-g</parameter> "
"option). This means that when debugging a program or library that was "
"compiled with debugging information, the debugger can provide not only "
"memory addresses, but also the names of the routines and variables."

"However, the inclusion of these debugging symbols enlarges a program or "
