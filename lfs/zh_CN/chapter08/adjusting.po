"the next command amends the GCC specs file to achieve three goals: first "
"point GCC to the new dynamic linker. Simply deleting all instances of "
"<quote>/tools</quote> should leave us with the correct path to the dynamic "
"linker. Second, let GCC know where to find the Glibc start files. Third, add "
"the /usr/include directory at the end of the default search path, so that "
