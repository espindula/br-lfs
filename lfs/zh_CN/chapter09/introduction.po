"Booting a Linux system involves several tasks.  The process must mount both "
"virtual and real file systems, initialize devices, activate swap, check file "
"systems for integrity, mount any swap partitions or files, set the system "
"clock, bring up networking, start any daemons required by the system, and "
"accomplish any other custom tasks needed by the user.  This process must be "
"organized to ensure the tasks are performed in the correct order but, at the "

"System V is the classic boot process that has been used in Unix and "
"Unix-like systems such as Linux since about 1983.  It consists of a small "
"program, <command>init</command>, that sets up basic programs such as "
"<command>login</command> (via getty) and runs a script.  This script, "
"usually named <command>rc</command>, controls the execution of a set of "
"additional scripts that perform the tasks required to initialize the system."
