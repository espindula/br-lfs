"The <filename>inputrc</filename> file is the configuration file for the "
"readline library, which provides editing capabilities while the user is "
"entering a line from the terminal. It works by translating keyboard inputs "

"Most people do not need user-specific functionality so the command below "
"creates a global <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> used by everyone who logs "

"basis, you can create a <filename>.inputrc</filename> file in the user's "
"home directory with the modified mappings."
