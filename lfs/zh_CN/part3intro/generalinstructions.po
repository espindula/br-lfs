"Several of the packages are patched before compilation, but only when the "
"patch is needed to circumvent a problem. A patch is often needed in both "
"this and the following chapters, but sometimes in only one location.  "
"Therefore, do not be concerned if instructions for a downloaded patch seem "
"to be missing.  Warning messages about <emphasis>offset</emphasis> or "
"<emphasis>fuzz</emphasis> may also be encountered when applying a patch. Do "
"not worry about these warnings, as the patch was still successfully applied."

"During the compilation of most packages, there will be several warnings that "
"scroll by on the screen. These are normal and can safely be ignored.  These "
"warnings are as they appear&mdash;warnings about deprecated, but not "
"invalid, use of the C or C++ syntax. C standards change fairly often, and "
"some packages still use the older standard. This is not a problem, but does "
"prompt the warning."
