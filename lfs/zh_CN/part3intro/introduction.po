"This part is divided into three stages: first building a cross compiler and "
"its associated libraries; second, use this cross toolchain to build several "
"utilities in a way that isolates them from the host distribution; third, "
"enter the chroot environment, which further improves host isolation, and "
"build the remaining tools needed to build the final system."

"With this part begins the real work of building a new system. It requires "
"much care in ensuring that the instructions are followed exactly as the book "
"shows them. You should try to understand what they do, and whatever your "
"eagerness to finish your build, you should refrain from blindly type them as "
"shown, but rather read documentation when there is something you do not "
"understand. Also, keep track of your typing and of the output of commands, "
"by sending them to a file, using the <command>tee</command> utility. This "
"allows for better diagnosing if something gets wrong."
