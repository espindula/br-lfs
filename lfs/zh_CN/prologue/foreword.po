"with the whole concept and philosophy behind Linux."

"从 1998 年起，我踏上了学习和深入理解 Linux 的旅程。当时我刚刚安装了我的第一个 Linux 发行版，并迅速被 Linux "

"There are always many ways to accomplish a single task. The same can be said "
"about Linux distributions. A great many have existed over the years.  Some "
"still exist, some have morphed into something else, yet others have been "
"relegated to our memories.  They all do things differently to suit the needs "
"of their target audience.  Because so many different ways to accomplish the "
"same end goal exist, I began to realize I no longer had to be limited by any "
"one implementation. Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues "
"in other Operating Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether "
"you liked it or not. With Linux, the concept of choice began to emerge.  If "
"you didn't like something, you were free, even encouraged, to change it."

"到并不需要将自己的思维约束在发行版这一种实现方法上。在发现 Linux "
"之前，我们只能忍受其他操作系统的种种不足，因为我们没有其他选择，操作系统的行为不以我们的意志为转移。然而，自由选择的理念随着 Linux "
"的诞生而出现。如果你不喜欢某种行为，就可以自由地改变它。这在 Linux 世界中甚至是受到鼓励的。"

"I tried a number of distributions and could not decide on any one. They were "
"great systems in their own right. It wasn't a matter of right and wrong "
"anymore. It had become a matter of personal taste. With all that choice "
"available, it became apparent that there would not be a single system that "
"would be perfect for me. So I set out to create my own Linux system that "
"would fully conform to my personal preferences."

"我曾经尝试了许多发行版，但无法做出最终决定。它们各有特色，都是很不错的系统。这里不存在对与错的问题，而是系统是否符合个人口味的问题。在各种选择中，看上去并"

"To truly make it my own system, I resolved to compile everything from source "
"code instead of using pre-compiled binary packages. This "
"<quote>perfect</quote> Linux system would have the strengths of various "

"daunting. I remained committed to the idea that such a system could be "

"After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and compile-time "
"errors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system. It was fully "
"operational and perfectly usable like any of the other Linux systems out "

"在整理并解决了循环依赖和编译错误等问题后，我终于构建出自己定制的 Linux 系统。它完全可以工作，并且像当时的其他 Linux "
"系统一样完美可用。不同的是，这是我自己的创造，亲手组装出这样的系统是非常有成就感的。唯一能够让我更开心的事情是亲自编写一个软件系统。"

"As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the Linux "
"community, it became apparent that there was a sustained interest in these "
"ideas. It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux systems serve "
"not only to meet user specific requirements, but also serve as an ideal "
"learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators to enhance "
"their (existing) Linux skills. Out of this broadened interest, the "
"<emphasis>Linux From Scratch Project</emphasis> was born."

"当我向其他 Linux 社区成员推广我的目标和经验时，大家似乎对这些想法很有兴趣。显而易见，这些自行定制的 Linux 系统不仅能够满足用户的特殊需求，"

"Scratch 项目</emphasis>诞生了。"
