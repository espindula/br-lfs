LSB-V3 Installation:

NOTE:  initd-tools must be installed prior to installation of these scripts.

initd-tools installation:

Download initd-tools from: 
http://www.dwcab.com/downloads/initd-tools/initd-tools-0.1.3.tar.gz

        ./configure &&
        make &&
        make check &&
        make install
    
Inline installation of lsb-v3 bootscripts:
        sudo make install

After LFS installation of lsb-v3 bootscripts:
        for file in /etc/rc.d /etc/sysconfig/rc /etc/sysconfig/modules \
            /etc/sysconfig/createfiles
        do
            mv $file $file.bak
        done &&
        make install

There is no longer an upgrade path for existing installations. You will have
to reinstall any bootscripts installed by BLFS or any self written scripts.
Fortunately, this will soon be very easy for BLFS scripts as a contrib 
directory containing lsb-v3 scripts will be added in the near future.

That's it!
