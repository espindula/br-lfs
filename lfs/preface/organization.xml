<para>This book is divided into the following parts. Although most of
the appendices is copied into part II (which enlarges the book somewhat), 
we believe it's the easiest way to read it like this. It simply saves
you from having to click to an Appendix, then back to where you were in
part II. That's a real chore especially if you're reading the TXT
version of this book.</para>
