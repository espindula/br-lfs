NAME
       ifup - bring a network interface up
       ifdown - take a network interface down

SYNOPSIS
       ifup  IFACE
       ifup -h|--help
       ifup -V|--version

       ifdown IFACE
       ifdown -h|--help
       ifdown -V|--version

DESCRIPTION
       The  ifup  and  ifdown  commands  may be used to configure 
       (or, respectively, deconfigure) a network interface based 
       on interface  definitions in the file 
       /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.IFACE.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version information.

EXAMPLE
       ifup eth0
              Bring up the interface defined in the file 
              /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0

       ifdown eth0:2
              Bring down the interface defined in the file
              /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0:2

NOTES
       The program does not configure network interfaces direct-
       ly.  It runs scripts defined by the SERVICE variable in 
       the network configuration file.

       The configuration files must have the following environ-
       ment variables set:

       IFACE   - The interface to configure, e.g. eth0.  It must 
                 be available in /sys/class/net.

       SERVICE - The service script to run to bring up the inter-
                 face.  Standard services are ipv4-static and 
                 ipv4-static-route.  Other services such as dhcp
                 may be installed.

       ONBOOT  - If set to 'yes', the specified interface is 
                 configured by the netowrk boot script.

       Other paramters that are service specific include:

       ipv4-static

         IP        - The IP address of the interface, 
                     e.g. 192.168.1.2.

         PREFIX    - The number of bits that specify the network
                     number of the interface, e.g., 24.
       
         GATEWAY   - The default IP address to use for routing 
                     if the destination IP address is not in a 
                     static route or on a local network, e.g., 
                     192.168.1.1.  For secondary IP addresses on
                     an interface, this parameter should not be 
                     specified.

         BROADCAST - The brodcast address for this interface, 
                     e.g 192.168.1.255.

       ipv4-static-route

         TYPE    -  The type of route, typically 'default', 
                    'network', 'or host'.

         IP      -  The IP address for a network or host, if thei
                    TYPE is not 'default'.

         PREFIX  -  The prefix for the associated IP address.

         GATEWAY -  The IP address for a network route.

         SOURCE  -  The source IP address to prefer when sending 
                    to the destinations covered by the specified
                    route. (optional)
