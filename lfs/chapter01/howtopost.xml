<title>How to post to a list</title>

<para>You do not need to be subscribed to a mailing list in order to post to it.
However, if you post to a list you're not subscribed to, make sure you
mention this in your email so the list members can put you in the CC:
header of an email in order for you receive the replies.</para>

<para>The post address for a list is in the format of
<emphasis>listname@linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis> where
<emphasis>listname</emphasis> can be one of the lists in the Available lists
section above. Examples of post addresses are 
<emphasis>lfs-dev@linuxfromscratch.org, lfs-support@linuxfromscratch.org and
blfs-support@linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis>.</para>
