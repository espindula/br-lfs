<para>LFS intends to be as far as possible platform independent.  Having
said that, the main LFS development work occurs on the x86 platform.  We
attempt to include information where possible on differences for other
platforms such as PPC.  If you come across a problem compiling which is
not related to the x86 platform, still feel free to ask for help on the
mailing lists.  Even better, if you come up with a solution to a
particular problem related to one of the other platforms, please let us
know at the lfs-dev mailing list.  We will then (subject to confirming
it works) include that in the book.</para>
