The udev-lfs set of files is a customization of systemd.
In 2012, udev was merged with systemd and a build methodology
incompatible with LFS.  These files extract the udev
code from systemd for LFS.

These files are distributed in the form of a tar file available
from the LFS file mirrors.  The tarball is created with:

mkdir /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION
cp -av * /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION
tar -jcf /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION.tar.bz2 -C /tmp udev-lfs-$VERSION

Makefile.lfs         - The main LFS Makefile.  Builds and installs
                       udev from systemd sources.

makefile-incl.keymap - BLFS makefile for keymap and supporting files
makefile-incl.gudev  - BLFS makefile for libgudev
makefile-incl.gir    - BLFS makefile for GObject files
