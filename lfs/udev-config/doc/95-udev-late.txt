Purpose of rules file:

Sends all uevents to a Unix-domain socket, where they can be monitored by other
programs.


Description of rules:

There is only one rule, which matches all uevents.  It uses Udev's RUN key to
specify a socket to send each uevent to.  Normally RUN is used to start up a
process, but if the pathname starts with "socket:", Udev instead interprets
the rest of the name as a Unix-domain socket to send the uevent to.  In this
case, we send send the uevent to the socket named /org/kernel/udev/monitor,
which is created by the udevmonitor program.  Udevmonitor is used to watch
uevents as they come to Udev.  Its only purpose is for debugging, but sending
the uevent to a socket that doesn't exist is a very cheap operation, so we
enable this rule for all uevents.
