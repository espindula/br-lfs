<para>This appendix describes the following aspects of every package
that is installed in this book:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>The official download location for the 
package.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What the package contains.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What each program from a package does.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What each package needs to compile.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Most information about these packages (especially the descriptions of
them) come from the man pages from those packages. We are not going to print
the entire man page, just the core elements to make it possible to
understand what a program does. To get knowledge of all details on a program, 
we suggest you start by reading the complete man page in addition to 
this appendix.</para>

<para>Certain packages are documented in more depth
than others, because we just happen to know more about certain
packages than I know about others. If anything should be added to the
following descriptions, please don't hesitate to email the mailing
lists.  We intend that the list should contain an in-depth description 
of every package installed, but we can't do it without help.</para>

<para>Please note that currently only what a package does is described and not
why it needs to be installed.  This may be added later.</para>

<para>Also listed are all of the installation dependencies for all the
packages that are installed in this book. The listings will include
which programs from which packages are needed to successfully compile
the package to be installed.</para>

<para>These are not running dependencies, meaning they don't tell you
what programs are needed to use that packages programs. Just the ones
needed to compile it.</para>

<para>The dependency list can be, from time to time, outdated in regards
to the current used package version. Checking dependencies takes quite a
bit of work, so they may lag behind a bit on the package update. But
often with minor package updates, the installation dependencies hardly
change, so they'll be current in most cases. If we upgrade to a major
new release, we'll make sure the dependencies are checked too at the
same time.</para>
