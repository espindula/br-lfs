<sect4><title>less</title>
<para>The less program is a file pager (or text viewer). It 
displays the contents of a file with the ability to scroll. Less is an 
improvement on the common pager called <quote>more</quote>. Less has 
the ability to scroll backwards through files as well and it doesn't need 
to read the entire file when it starts, which makes it faster when reading 
large files.</para></sect4>
