"Now that LFS is complete and you have a bootable system, what do you do? The "
"next step is to decide how to use it. Generally, there are two broad "
"categories to consider: workstation or server. Indeed, these categories are "
"not mutually exclusive. The applications needed for each category can be "
"combined onto a single system, but let's look at them separately for now."

"A server is the simpler category. Generally this consists of a web server "
"such as the <ulink url=\"&blfs-book;server/apache.html\">Apache HTTP Server</"
"ulink> and a database server such as <ulink url=\"&blfs-book;server/mariadb."
"html\">MariaDB</ulink>.  However other services are possible. The operating "
"system embedded in a single use device falls into this category."

"On the other hand, a workstation is much more complex. It generally requires "

"thunderbird.html\">Thunderbird email client</ulink>, or <ulink url=\"&blfs-"
