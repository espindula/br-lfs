  <title>Cleaning up and Saving the Temporary System</title>
  
  <sect2>
    <title>Cleaning</title>

    <para>First, remove the currently installed documentation to prevent them from
ending up in the final system, and to save about 35 MB:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /usr/share/{info,man,doc}/*</userinput></screen>

    <para>Second, the libtool .la files are only useful when linking with static
libraries. They are unneeded and potentially harmful when using dynamic
shared libraries, specially when using non-autotools build systems.  While
still in chroot, remove those files now:</para>

<screen><userinput>find /usr/{lib,libexec} -name \*.la -delete</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      The current system size is now about 3 GB, however the /tools directory is
no longer needed. It uses about 1 GB of disk space.  Delete it now:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /tools</userinput></screen>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Backup</title>

    <note><para>
      All the remaining steps in this section are optional. Nevertheless, as soon
as you begin installing packages in <xref
linkend="chapter-building-system"/>, the temporary files will be
overwritten. So it may be a good idea to do a backup of the current system
as described below. 
    </para></note>
  
    <para>
      The following steps are performed from outside the chroot environment. That
means, you have to leave the chroot environment first before continuing. The
reason for that is to get access to file system locations outside of the
chroot environment to store/read the backup archive which should not be
placed within the <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename> hierarchy for
safety reasons.
    </para>

    <important>
      <para>All of the following instructions are executed by <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem>. Take extra care about the commands
you're going to run as mistakes here can modify your host system. Be aware
that the environment variable <envar>LFS</envar> is set for user <systemitem
class="username">lfs</systemitem> by default but may
<emphasis>not</emphasis> be set for <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem>. Whenever commands are to be executed by
<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, make sure you have set
<envar>LFS</envar>.  This has been discussed in <xref
linkend='ch-partitioning-aboutlfs'/>.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
       Now, if you are making a backup, leave the chroot environment:
    </para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>exit</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      At this point the essential programs and libraries have been created and
your current system is in a good state. Your system can now be backed up for
later reuse. In case of fatal failures in the subsequent chapters, it often
turns out that removing everything and starting over (more carefully) is the
best option to recover. Unfortunately, all the the temporary files will be
removed, too. To avoid spending extra time to redo something which has been
built successfully, prepare a backup.
    </para>

    <para>
      Make sure you have at least 1 GB free disk space (the source tarballs will
be included in the backup archive) in the home directory of user <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem>.
    </para>

    <para>Before we make a backup, unmount the virtual file systems:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>umount $LFS/dev{/pts,}
umount $LFS/{sys,proc,run}</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Create the backup archive by running the following command:
    </para>

    <note>
       <para>
          Because the backup archive is compressed, it takes a relatively long time
(over 10 minutes) even on a resonably fast system.
       </para>
       
       <para>
          Also, ensure the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable is set for the root
user.
       </para>
    </note>

<screen role="nodump" revision="sysv"><userinput>cd $LFS 
tar -cJpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-&version;.tar.xz .</userinput></screen>

<screen role="nodump" revision="systemd"><userinput>cd $LFS 
tar -cJpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-&versiond;.tar.xz .</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Replace <envar>$HOME</envar> by a directory of your choice if you do not
want to have the backup stored in <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem>'s home directory.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Restore</title>

    <para>
      In case some mistakes have been made and you need to start over, you can use
this backup to restore the system and save some recovery time.  Since the
sources are located under <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename>, they
are included in the backup archive as well, so they do not need to be
downloaded again. After checking that <envar>$LFS</envar> is set properly,
restore the backup by executing the following commands:
    </para>



    <!-- Make the following look different so users don't blindly run the
     restore when they don't need to. -->
<warning><para>The following commands are extremly dangerous.  If you run <command>rm -rf
./*</command> as the root user and you do not change to the $LFS directory
or the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable is not set for the root user,
it will destroy your entire host system.  YOU ARE WARNED.</para></warning>

<screen role="nodump" revision="sysv"><computeroutput>cd $LFS 
rm -rf ./* 
tar -xpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-&version;.tar.xz</computeroutput></screen>

<screen role="nodump" revision="systemd"><computeroutput>cd $LFS 
rm -rf ./* 
tar -xpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-&versiond;.tar.xz</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>
       Again, double check that the environment has been setup properly and
continue building the rest of the system.
    </para>

    <important>
      <para>
         If you left the chroot environment to create a backup or restart building
using a restore, remember to check that the virtual filesystems are still
mounted (<command>findmnt | grep $LFS</command>).  If they are not mounted,
remount them now as described in <xref linkend='ch-tools-kernfs'/> and
re-enter the chroot environment (see <xref linkend='ch-tools-chroot'/>)
before continuing.
       </para>
    </important>
