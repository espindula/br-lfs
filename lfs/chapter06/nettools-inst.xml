<title>Installation of Net-tools</title>

<para>Install Net-tools by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make &amp;&amp;
make update</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you want to accept all the default answers, you can run these
commands instead:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>yes "" | make &amp;&amp;
make update</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you don't know what to answer to all the questions asked during
the <userinput>make</userinput> phase, then just accept the defaults, which
will be just in fine in the majority of the cases. What you are asked here
are a bunch of questions relating to the kind of network protocols that you
have enabled in your kernel.</para>

<para>The default answers will enable the tools from this package to work
with the most common protocols such as TCP, PPP and a bunch of others. You
still need to actually enable these protocols in the kernel. What you do
here is merely telling the programs to be able to use those protocols but
it's up to the kernel to make it available to the system.</para>
