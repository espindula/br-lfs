<title>Changing ownership of the LFS partition</title>
<?dbhtml filename="changingowner.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>Now we're in chroot, it is a good time to change the ownership of
all files and directories that were installed in chapter 5 back to root.
Run the following commands to do so:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd / &amp;&amp;
chown 0.0 . proc &amp;&amp;
chown -R 0.0 bin boot dev etc home lib mnt opt root sbin tmp usr var</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Depending on the filesystem you created on the LFS partition, you may
have a /lost+found directory. If so, run:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>chown 0.0 lost+found</userinput></screen></para>

<para>These commands will change the ownership of the root partition and
the <filename>/proc</filename> directory to root, plus everything under
the directories mentioned in the second line. In these commands, 0.0 is
used instead of the usual root.root, because the username root can't be
resolved because glibc is not yet installed.</para>
