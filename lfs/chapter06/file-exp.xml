<para><userinput>touch aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.in stamp-h.in</userinput>:
This command works around an error which occurs when compiling file with
automake-1.5 installed by changing the modification dates of some files to
the current date. Changing the date will cause make to think the files are
already up-to-date so they're not recreated.</para>
