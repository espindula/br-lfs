<para><userinput>sed 's/\(.*\) (nflg || \(.*\))\(.*\)/\1\2\3/'
src/useradd.c.backup &gt; src/useradd.c &amp;&amp;</userinput>:
This sed is used to fix a compilation bug which occurs due to a
variable (nflg) being used but not defined.</para>

<para><userinput>cp limits login.access /etc:</userinput> These files
were not installed during the installation of the package so we copy
them manually as those files are used to configure authentication
details on the system.</para>

<para><userinput>sed "s%/var/spool/mail%/var/mail%" login.defs.linux &gt;
/etc/login.defs</userinput>: /var/spool/mail is the old location of the
user mailboxes. The location that is used nowadays is /var/mail.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -sf vipw vigr</userinput> and
<userinput>ln -sf vipw.8 vigr.8</userinput>: According to the manpage of
vipw, vigr should be a symlink to it. Because the shadow installation
procedure doesn't create these symlinks, we create them manually.</para>
