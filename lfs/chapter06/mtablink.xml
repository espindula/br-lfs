<title>Creating the /etc/mtab symlink</title>
<?dbhtml filename="mtablink.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>The next thing to do is to create a symlink pointing from
/etc/mtab to /proc/mounts.  This is done using the following
command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Creating this symlink avoids problems which can occur if / is
mounted read-only and the information in /etc/mtab is stale (i.e. out of
date).  By creating the symlink to /proc/mounts, we ensure that
/etc/mtab will always be up-to-date.</para>

<para>Note that using this symlink requires that you have /proc
filesystem support compiled into your kernel.  This is included by
default and should not be removed unless you <emphasis>really</emphasis>
know what you are doing as  many more things than just the /etc/mtab
symlink depend on /proc being present.  In summary, make sure you have
/proc filesystem support in your kernel.</para>
