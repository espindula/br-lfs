<title>Entering the chroot'ed environment</title>

<para>It's time to enter our chroot'ed environment in order to install the
rest of the software we need.</para>

<para>Enter the following commands to enter the chroot'ed environment. From
this point on there's no need to use the $LFS variable anymore, because
everything a user does will be restricted to the LFS partition (since / is
actually /mnt/lfs but the shell doesn't know that).</para>

<para><screen>&c6-chrootcmd;</screen></para>

<para>The -i option will clear all environment variables for as long as you
are in the chroot'ed environment and only the HOME and TERM variables
are set. The TERM=$TERM construction will set the TERM variable inside
chroot to the same value as outside chroot which is needed for programs
like vim and less to operate properly. If you need other variables
present, such as CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS, you need to set them again.</para>

<para>The reason we do <userinput>cd $LFS</userinput> before running the
<userinput>chroot</userinput> command is that older sh-utils packages 
have a chroot program which doesn't do the cd by itself, therefore
meaning that we have to perform it manually.  While this isn't an issue 
with most modern distributions, it does no harm anyways and ensures that 
the command works for everyone.</para>

<para>Now that we are inside a chroot'ed environment, we can continue to
install all the basic system software. You have to make sure all the
following commands in this and following chapters are run from within the 
chroot'ed environment. If you ever leave this environment for any reason
(when rebooting for example) please remember to mount $LFS/proc 
again and re-enter chroot before continuing with the
book.</para>

<para>Note that the bash prompt will contain "I have no name!" This is
normal because Glibc hasn't been installed yet.</para>
