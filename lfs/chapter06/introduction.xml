<para>The installation of all the software is pretty straightforward and
you will probably think it's so much easier and shorter to give the generic 
installation instructions for each package and only explain how to 
install something if a certain package requires an alternate installation 
method. Although I agree on that, I choose to give the 
full instructions for each and every package. This is simply to avoid any 
possible confusion and errors.</para>

<para>Now would be a good time to take a look at the optimization hint at <ulink
url="&hints-root;optimization.txt">&hints-root;optimization.txt</ulink> 
if you plan on using compiler optimization for the packages
installed in the following chapter. Compiler optimization can make a program run
faster, but may also cause some compilation problems. If you run into problems
after having used optimization, always try it without optimizing to see if 
the problem persists.</para>
