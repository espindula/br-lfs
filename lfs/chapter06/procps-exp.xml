<para><userinput>make XSCPT='' install:</userinput> 
This will set the Makefile variable XSCPT to an empty value so that
the XConsole installation is disabled. Otherwise "Make install" tries to
copy the file XConsole to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults. And that directory 
does not exist, because X is not installed.</para>
