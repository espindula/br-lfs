<title>Installation of Ed</title>

<para>Ed isn't something you would personally use. It's installed here
because it can be used by the patch program if you encounter an ed-based patch
file. This happens rarely because diff-based patches are preferred these
days.</para>

<para>Install Ed by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp buf.c buf.c.backup &amp;&amp;
sed 's/int u/int u, sfd/' buf.c.backup | \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed '/.*\*mktemp.*/d' | \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed 's/.*if (mktemp.*/  sfd = mkstemp(sfn);\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((sfd == -1) || (sfp = fopen (sfn, "w+")) == NULL)/' &gt; buf.c &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
mv /usr/bin/ed /usr/bin/red /bin</userinput></screen></para>
