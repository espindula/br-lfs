<title>Installation of LFS-Bootscripts</title>

<para>We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style
because it is widely used and we feel comfortable with it. If you want to
try something else, someone has written an LFS-Hint on BSD style init
scripts at <ulink
url="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt">&hints-root;bsd-init.txt</ulink>.</para>

<para>If you decide to use BSD style, or some other style scripts, you can
skip chapter 7 when you arive at it and move on to chapter 8.</para>

<para>Install LFS-Bootscripts by running the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -a rc.d sysconfig /etc &amp;&amp;
chown -R root.root /etc/rc.d /etc/sysconfig</userinput></screen></para>
