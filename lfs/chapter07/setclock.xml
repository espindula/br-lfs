<para>The setclock script is only for real use when the hardware clock (also
known as BIOS or CMOS clock) isn't set to GMT time. The recommended
setup is setting the hardware clock to GMT and having the time converted
to localtime using the /etc/localtime symbolic link. But if an
OS is run that doesn't understand a clock set to GMT (most notable are
Microsoft OS'es) you may want to set the clock to localtime so that
the time is properly displayed on those OS'es. This script will then 
set the kernel time to the hardware clock without converting the time using
the /etc/localtime symlink.</para>

<para>If you want to use this script on your system even if the
hardware clock is set to GMT, then the UTC variable below has to be
changed to the value of <emphasis>1</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Create a new file <filename>/etc/sysconfig/clock</filename> by running
the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/sysconfig/clock &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/clock

UTC=0

# End /etc/sysconfig/clock
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now, you may want to take a look at a very good hint explaining how we
deal with time on LFS at <ulink 
url="&hints-root;time.txt">&hints-root;time.txt</ulink>. 
It explains issues such as timezones, UTC, and the TZ environment
variable.</para>
