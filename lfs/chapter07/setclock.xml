<title>Configuring the setclock script</title>
<?dbhtml filename="setclock.html" dir="chapter07"?>

<para>This setclock script reads the time from your hardware clock (also
known as BIOS or CMOS clock) and either converts that time to localtime
using the <filename>/etc/localtime</filename> file (if the hardware clock
is set to GMT) or not (if the hardware clock is already set to localtime).
There is no way to auto-detect whether the hardware clock is set to GMT or
not, so we need to configure that here ourselves.</para>

<para>Change the value of the <emphasis>UTC</emphasis> variable below to a
<emphasis>0</emphasis> (zero) if your hardware clock is not set to GMT
time.</para>

<para>Create a new file <filename>/etc/sysconfig/clock</filename> by running
the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/sysconfig/clock &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/clock

UTC=1

# End /etc/sysconfig/clock
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now, you may want to take a look at a very good hint explaining how we
deal with time on LFS at <ulink 
url="&hints-root;time.txt">&hints-root;time.txt</ulink>. 
It explains issues such as timezones, UTC, and the TZ environment
variable.</para>
