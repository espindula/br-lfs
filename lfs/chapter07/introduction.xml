<para>This chapter will setup the bootscripts that you installed in chapter
6. Most of these scripts will work without needing to modify them, but a
few do require additional configuration files setup as they deal with
hardware dependant information.</para>

<para>We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style 
because it is widely used and we feel comfortable with it. If you want to 
try something else, someone has written an LFS-Hint on BSD style init scripts 
at <ulink
url="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt">&hints-root;bsd-init.txt</ulink>
