<para>You only need to use the loadkeys script if you don't have a 
default 101 keys US keyboard layout.</para>

<para>The /etc/sysconfig/keyboard file contains the information the
loadkeys script needs to operate. This file contains the LAYOUT variable
which tells loadkeys what keymap to load that corresponds with your
keyboard.</para>

<para>Create a new file <filename>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</filename> 
by running the following:</para>
 
<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/sysconfig/keyboard &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput
>
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/keyboard
 
LAYOUT=&lt;path-to-keymap&gt;
 
# End /etc/sysconfig/keyboard
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Replace <userinput>&lt;path-to-keymap&gt;</userinput> with the
path to the keymap you have selected.  For example, if you have chosen the 
US keymap, you would replace it with 
<userinput>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.map.gz</userinput></para>
