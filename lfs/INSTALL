LFS Book Conversion Tools Installation Instructions

After downloading the CVS source, there are some things that need to be set up 
on your computer if you want to convert the XML source into something easier to 
read (e.g. HTML, TXT, PS or PDF).  If you are interested in this, then keep 
reading.  If you are only interested in editing the XML source for re- 
submission to the lfs-book or lfs-dev mailing lists, then you do not need this 
document.  Instead, you need to read the LFS Editor's Manual.  See the LFS 
website at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If all you want to do is convert XML to HTML install the following:

* libxml2
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/libxml2.html

* libxslt
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/libxslt.html

* DocBook DTD 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/xml.html

* DocBook XSL Stylesheets 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/docbook-xsl.html

* HTML Tidy - http://tidy.sourceforge.net/src/tidy_src.tgz

  /bin/sh build/gnuauto/setup.sh &&
  ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
  make &&
  su -c "make install"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
If you want to be able to convert the book into PDF as well, then you will need
the FOP package.  This takes an XSL-FO file (created with libxslt which you
already installed) and converts it to PDF.  Additionally you will need
the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library from
http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-1_1_2.html
(you'll need either the JDK .bin or JRE .bin file dependent on your
particular Java setup).

  - http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/fop/fop-0.20.5-bin.tar.gz

  Install FOP by running:

  cd /opt &&
  tar -xzvf /usr/src/fop-0.20.5-bin.tar.gz &&
  mv fop-0.20.5 fop

  Install JAI by running:

  chmod u+x /path/to/jai-1_1_2-lib-linux-i586-jdk.bin &&
  cd $JAVA_HOME &&
  /path/to/jai-1_1_2-lib-linux-i586-jdk.bin

  Now set JAVA_HOME, FOP_HOME and PATH to values appropriate to your system.
