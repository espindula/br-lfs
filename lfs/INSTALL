LFS Book Conversion Tools Installation Instructions

After downloading the CVS source, there are some things that need to be setup 
on your computer if you want to convert the XML source into something easier to 
read (e.g. HTML, TXT, PS or PDF).  If you are interested in this, then keep 
reading.  If you are only interested in editing the XML source for re- 
submission to the lfs-book or lfs-dev mailing lists, then you do not need this 
document.  Instead, you need to read the LFS Editor's Manual.  See the LFS 
website at http://linuxfromscratch.org for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If all you want to do is convert XML to HTML perform the following:

First, let's handle some dependancies:

* Unzip
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/unzip.html

* SGML Common
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/sgml-common.html

* libxml2
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/libxml2.html

Now install the following:

* DocBook DTD 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/DocBook.html
  
* DSSSL DocBook Stylesheets 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/docbook-dsssl.html

* OpenSP 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/opensp.html

* OpenJade 
  - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/openjade.html

Once you have followed the installation instructions for all these packages 
from the BLFS Book, then you have a basic DocBook setup.  Below are some 
alternate packages that you can use to convert to other formats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
If you want to be able to convert the book into PS and PDF as well, then you 
will need the Htmldoc package. This takes a HTML file (created with openjade 
which you already installed) and converts it to PS or PDF:

  - http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/
  
  Install HTMLDOC by running:
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

An excellent X front-end for HTMLDOC is FLTK.  If you will be doing rendering 
in X, then you will probably want this package.

  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/fltk

  Install FLTK bt running:
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

If you want to be able to convert the book into TXT as well, then you need the 
lynx browser.  Conversion is handled via the -dump option.

You are finished installing everything.  Read the README file for some examples 
how to convert this XML to the various other formats.
