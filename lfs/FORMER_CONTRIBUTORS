The list of contributors to the LFS project is getting longer and
longer as time goes by. Active contributors are listed in the book,
both online and the paperback printed editions.

Unfortunately, due to space constraints and aesthetics, former
contributors cannot all be listed in the online and printed books.
There are simply too many of them. Instead of removing traces of them
altogether, this file will list the people who used to be involved
with the LFS project and have left it since for whatever reason.
Often, their hard work still has effects on the products today, which
is why their names will be listed here.

As many people come and go, this list will be incomplete. If you are
missing from this file and think you should be added, drop us a line
at lfs-dev@linuxfromscratch.org and we will gladly add you.
