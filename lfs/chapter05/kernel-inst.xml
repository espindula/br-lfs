<title>Installation of the Linux Kernel</title>

<para>We won't be compiling a new kernel image yet. We'll do that after we
have finished the installation of the basic system software in this
chapter. But because certain software needs the kernel header files, we're
going to unpack the kernel archive now and set it up so that we can
compile the packages that need the kernel.</para>

<para>The kernel configuration file is created by running the following 
command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make mrproper &amp;&amp;
yes "" | make config &amp;&amp;
make dep &amp;&amp;
mkdir $LFS/usr/include/asm &amp;&amp;
cp include/asm/* $LFS/usr/include/asm &amp;&amp;
cp -R include/linux $LFS/usr/include</userinput></screen></para>
