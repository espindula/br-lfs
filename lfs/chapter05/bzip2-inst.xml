<title>Installation of Bzip2</title>

<para>Install Bzip2 by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make CC="gcc -static" &amp;&amp;
make PREFIX=$LFS/usr install &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/usr/bin &amp;&amp;
mv bzcat bunzip2 bzip2 bzip2recover bzless bzmore $LFS/bin</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Although it's not strictly a part of a basic LFS system it's worth
mentioning that a patch for Tar can be downloaded which enables the tar
program to compress and uncompress using bzip2/bunzip2 easily. With a
plain tar, you have to use constructions like bzcat file.tar.bz|tar
xv or tar --use-compress-prog=bunzip2 -xvf file.tar.bz2 to use bzip2 and
bunzip2 with tar. This patch provides the -j option so you can unpack a
Bzip2 archive with tar xvfj file.tar.bz2. Applying this patch will be
mentioned later on when the Tar package is installed.</para>
