<title>Installation of Sh-utils</title>

<para>Before Sh-utils is installed, the sh-utils patch file may need to
be applied.  This patch is needed to avoid a conflict of variable names
with certain Glibc versions (usually glibc-2.1.x) when compiling sh-utils 
statically.  It is however safe to apply the patch even if you are
running a different glibc version, so if you aren't sure, it's
best to apply it.</para>

<para>Apply the patch by running the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../sh-utils-&sh-utils-version;.patch</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install Sh-utils by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/usr --disable-nls &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/usr/bin &amp;&amp;
mv basename date echo false hostname $LFS/bin &amp;&amp;
mv pwd sleep stty test true uname $LFS/bin &amp;&amp;
mv chroot ../sbin</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install stage you will see the following warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>WARNING: insufficient access; not installing su
NOTE: to install su, run 'make install-root' as root</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore that warning. You need to be logged in as root
in order to install su the way sh-utils wants to install it, that being
suid root. Because we don't need su during chapter 6, and su will be properly
installed when we re-install sh-utils in chapter 6 anyways, you can just
pretend you didn't see it.</para>
