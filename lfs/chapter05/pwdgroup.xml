<title>Creating passwd and group files</title>

<para>In order for the user and group root to be recognized and to be able to 
login, there needs to be an entry in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group file. 
Besides the group root, a couple of other groups are recommended and needed by
packages. The groups with their GID's below aren't part of any standard.
The LSB only recommends a group bin with GID 1 to be present besides 
group root. Other group names and GID's can be chosen by the user. Well
written packages don't depend on GID numbers but just use the group
name, so it doesn't matter which GID a group has. Since there
aren't any standards for groups the groups created here are the groups the
MAKEDEV script (the script that creates the device files in the /dev
directory) mentions.</para>
