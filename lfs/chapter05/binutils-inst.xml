<title>Installation of Binutils</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its default
optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options). Binutils is 
best left alone, so we recommend you unsetting CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and other
such variables/settings that would change the default optimization that
it comes with.</para>

<para>Install Binutils by running the following commands:</para>
