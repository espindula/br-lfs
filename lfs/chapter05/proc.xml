<title>Mounting $LFS/proc file system</title>
<?dbhtml filename="proc.html" dir="chapter05"?>

<para>In order for certain programs to function properly, the proc file
system must be mounted and available from within the chroot'ed environment
as well. It's not a problem to mount the proc file system (or any other
file system for that matter) twice or even more than that.</para>

<para>If you're still logged in as user "lfs", you should log out and log
in again as user root. The reason for this is simple: only root is allowed
to mount filesystems and to run chroot.</para>

<para>The proc file system is mounted under $LFS/proc by running the
following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mount proc $LFS/proc -t proc</userinput></screen></para>
