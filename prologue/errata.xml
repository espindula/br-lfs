  <title>Errata and Security Advisories</title>

  <para>The software used to create an LFS system is constantly being updated
  and enhanced. Security warnings and bug fixes may become available after
  the LFS book has been released. To check whether the package versions or
  instructions in this release of LFS need any modifications&mdash;to repair
  security vulnerabilities or to fix other bugs&mdash;please visit
  <ulink url="&errata;"/>
  before proceeding with your build. You should note any
  changes shown and apply them to the relevant sections of the book as you
  build the LFS system.</para>

  <para>In addition, the Linux From Scratch editors maintain a list of security
  vulnerabilities discovered <emphasis>after</emphasis> a book has been released. To see
  whether there  are any known security vulnerabilities, please visit
  <ulink url="&secadv;"/> before proceeding with your build. You should also continue
  to consult the advisories, and fix any security vulnerabilities, even
  when the LFS system has been completely constructed.</para>
