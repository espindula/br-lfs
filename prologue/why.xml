  <title>Rationale for Packages in the Book</title>

    <para>The goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable
    foundation-level system&mdash;including all the packages needed to replicate
    itself&mdash;and providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize
    a more complete system based on the user's choices.  This does not
    mean that LFS is the smallest system possible.  Several important packages
    are included that are not, strictly speaking, required.  The list below documents the
    reasons each package in the book has been included.</para>
