  <title>Prerequisites</title>

  <para>Building an LFS system is not a simple task. It requires a certain
  level of existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to resolve
  problems and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular, as an
  absolute minimum, you should already know how to use the
  command line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list directory
  and file contents, and change the current directory. It is also expected that
  you know how to use and install Linux
  software.</para>

  <para>Because the LFS book assumes <emphasis>at least</emphasis> this basic
  level of skill, the various LFS support forums are unlikely to
  provide you with much assistance in these areas. You will find that your
  questions regarding such basic knowledge will likely go unanswered (or you
  will simply be referred to the LFS essential pre-reading list).</para>

  <para>Before building an LFS system, we urge you to read these articles:</para>
