  <title>Mounting the New Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a file system has been created, the partition must
  be mounted so the host system can access it. This book assumes that
  the file system is mounted at the directory specified by the
  <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <para>Create the mount point and mount the LFS file system with these commands:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the LFS
  partition.</para>

  <para>If you are using multiple partitions for LFS (e.g., one for
  <filename class="directory">/</filename> and another for <filename
  class="directory">/home</filename>), mount them like this:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS
mkdir -v $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> $LFS/home</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> and
  <replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> with the appropriate partition
  names.</para>

  <para>Ensure that this new partition is not mounted with permissions that are
  too restrictive (such as the <option>nosuid</option> or
  <option>nodev</option> options). Run the <command>mount</command> command
  without any parameters to see what options are set for the mounted LFS
  partition. If <option>nosuid</option> and/or <option>nodev</option> are set,
  the partition must be remounted.</para>

  <warning><para>The above instructions assume that you will not restart
  your computer throughout the LFS process.  If you shut down your system,
  you will either need to remount the LFS partition each time you restart
  the build process, or modify the host system's /etc/fstab file to automatically
  remount it when you reboot. For example, you might add this line to your 
  /etc/fstab file:

<screen role="nodump">/dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable>  /mnt/lfs ext4   defaults      1     1</screen>

  If you use additional optional partitions, be sure to add them also.

  </para></warning>


  <para>If you are using a <systemitem
  class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition, ensure that it is enabled
  using the <command>swapon</command> command:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>/sbin/swapon -v /dev/<replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the
  <systemitem class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition.</para>

  <para>Now that the new LFS partition is open for business, it's time to
  download the packages.</para>
