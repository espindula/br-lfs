  <title>About ${CLFS}</title>

  <para>Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>CLFS</envar> will
  be used several times. It is paramount that this variable is always defined.
  It should be set to the mount point chosen for the CLFS partition.
  Check that the <envar>CLFS</envar> variable is set up properly with:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the CLFS partition's mount
  point, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/clfs</filename> if the
  provided example was followed. If the output is incorrect, the
  variable can be set with:</para>

<screen><userinput>export CLFS=/mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Having this variable set is beneficial in that commands such as
  <command>install -dv ${CLFS}/tools</command> can be typed literally. The shell
  will automatically replace <quote>${CLFS}</quote> with
  <quote>/mnt/clfs</quote> (or whatever the variable was set to) when it
  processes the command line.</para>

  <para>If you haven't created the <filename class="directory">${CLFS}</filename>
  directory, do so at this time by issuing the following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Do not forget to check that <envar>${CLFS}</envar> is set whenever
  you leave and reenter the current working environment (as when doing a
  <quote>su</quote> to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> or
  another user).</para>
