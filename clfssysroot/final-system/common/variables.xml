  <title>Build Variables</title>

  <para>Throughout this book, you will see a reference to different environment variables to be set and unset for different builds. The commands to set and unset the variables should be present on every page where compilation occurs. It may be unnecessary to run these commands each time as long as you're aware of what is set in your current enviornment.</para>
