  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para os="a">In this chapter, we use the cross-compile tools to build
  the final CLFS system. The installation of this software is
  straightforward. Although in many cases the installation instructions
  could be made shorter and more generic, we have opted to provide the full
  instructions for every package to minimize the possibilities for mistakes.
  The key to learning what makes a Linux system work is to know what each
  package is used for and why the user (or the system) needs it. For every
  installed package, a summary of its contents is given, followed by concise
  descriptions of each program and library the package installed.</para>

  <para os="b">If using compiler optimizations, please review the
  optimization hint at <ulink url="&hints-root;Optimization"/>.
  Compiler optimizations can make a program run slightly faster, but
  they may also cause compilation difficulties and problems when
  running the program. If a package refuses to compile when using
  optimization, try to compile it without optimization and see if
  that fixes the problem. Even if the package
  does compile when using optimization, there is the risk it may have
  been compiled incorrectly because of the complex interactions between
  the code and build tools.  Also note that the <option>-march</option>
  and <option>-mtune</option> options may cause problems with the toolchain
  packages (Binutils, GCC and EGLIBC). The small potential gains achieved in
  using compiler optimizations are often outweighed by the risks. First-time
  builders of CLFS are encouraged to build without custom optimizations.
  The subsequent system will still run very fast and be stable at the
  same time.</para>

  <para os="c">The order that packages are installed in this chapter needs to
  be strictly followed to ensure that all package dependencies are
  fulfilled.</para>

  <para os="d">To keep track of which package installs particular files, a
  package manager can be used. For a general overview of different styles of
  package managers, please take a look at the next page.</para>
