  <title>Rebooting the System</title>

  <para>The system you have created in this book is quite minimal, and most
  likely will not have the functionality you would need to be able to
  continue forward. By installing a few extra packages from the BLFS
  book while still in our current chroot environment, you can leave
  yourself in a much better position to continue on once you reboot
  into your new CLFS installation. Installing a text mode web browser,
  such as Lynx, you can easily view the BLFS book in one virtual terminal,
  while building packages in another. The GPM package will also allow you
  to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual terminals. Lastly, if you
  are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet your
  networking requirements, installing packages such as Dhcpcd or PPP at
  this point might also be useful.</para>

  <para>Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny
  new CLFS installation for the first time! Reboot the system with:</para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

  <para>Assuming the boot loader was set up as outlined earlier,
  <emphasis>CLFS &version;</emphasis> will boot automatically.</para>

  <para>When the reboot is complete, the CLFS system is ready for use and
  more software may be added to suit your needs.</para>
