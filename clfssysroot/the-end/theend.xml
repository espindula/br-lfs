  <para>Well done! The new CLFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para>It may be a good idea to create an
  <filename>/etc/clfs-release</filename> file. By having this file, it is
  very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some
  point) to find out which CLFS version is installed on the system.
  Create this file by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; ${CLFS}/etc/clfs-release &lt;&lt; EOF
CLFS-Sysroot-&version;
EOF</userinput></screen>
