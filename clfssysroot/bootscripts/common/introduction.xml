  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter details how to install and configure the CLFS-Bootscripts
  package. Most of these scripts will work without modification, but a few
  require additional configuration files because they deal with
  hardware-dependent information.</para>

  <para>System-V style init scripts are employed in this book because they
  are widely used. For additional options, a hint detailing the BSD style
  init setup is available at <ulink
  url="&hints-root;BSD-Init"/>.
  Searching the LFS mailing lists for <quote>depinit</quote> will also offer
  additional choices.</para>

  <para>If using an alternative style of init scripts, skip this chapter and
  move on to <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>.</para>
