  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This part is divided into three stages: first, building a cross
  compiler and its associated libraries; second, using this cross toolchain
  to build several utilities in a way that isolates them from the host
  distribution; and third, entering the chroot environment (which further improves
  host isolation) and constructing the remaining tools needed to build the final
  system.</para>

  <important><para>This is where the real work of building a new system
  begins. Be very careful to follow the instructions exactly as the book
  shows them. You should try to understand what each command does,
  and no matter how eager you are to finish your build, you should
  refrain from blindly typing the commands as shown. Read the documentation when
  there is something you do not understand. Also, keep track of your typing
  and of the output of commands, by using the <command>tee</command> utility
  to send the terminal output to a file. This makes debugging easier
  if something goes wrong.</para></important>

  <para>The next section is a technical introduction to the build process,
  while the following one presents <emphasis role="strong">very
  important</emphasis> general instructions.</para>
