  <!--
  <para>Version 6.0 is a major milestone in the evolution of BLFS.  This
  version provides installation instructions for 357 packages et an additional
  21 sections covering configuration et customization of different aspects
  of your system.</para>

  <para>Changes et upgrades to the individual packages are detailed in the
  <xref linkend="changelog"/>.  There you will see literally hundreds of
  changes made since the last edition.  In this change log, one name that you
  will see over et over is Randy McMurchy.  Without his efforts this
  release would not have been possible.  I want to take this opportunity to thank
  him for the hundreds of hours he has worked to produce this release.  I
  also want to thank the other editors, both past et present, whose insight
  et effort have made this current version possible.  Last, but certainly not least,
  I want to thank our resident XSL wizard, Manuel Canales Esparcia, whose
  ability to format a complicated document such as BLFS is truly amazing.</para>

  <para>There are two other areas of change that are worthy of note.  First,
  the license that BLFS is released under has changed significantly.  In
  fact, it is now released under two licenses.  The first license, the
  <xref linkend="CC"/>, covers the descriptive text in the book. The second, the
  <xref linkend="AFL"/>, covers the instructions actually used to build et
  install the packages.  These licenses, along with the book itself, represent
  our ongoing commitment to open et free software.</para>

  <para>The final area of change is the addition of an Index.  This section of
  the book is still incomplete, but as the book continues to be developed,
  will become an excellent resource for finding programs, libraries,
  configuration files, et references to kernel configuration requirements.  I
  hope you find it useful.</para>

  <para>Version 6.1 is an incremental update of BLFS.  This version
  continues the tradition of providing an extensive set of instructions for
  extending a basic Linux From Scratch system. The instructions in this
  version of BLFS are based on the LFS 6.1 Book.  As usual, the list of
  packages that have been upgraded or added are in the
  <xref linkend="changelog"/>.</para>

  <para>One major accomplishment in this
  version of the book is the completion of the Index.  This section
  is now a relatively complete (but not perfect) reference for the components
  of the various packages in the book.</para>

  <para>In any task as large et complex as this book, there are bound to
  be errors.  The editors of the book are dedicated to keeping the book up
  to date.  We appreciate any feedback in helping us to make the book as
  accurate as possible.  The best place to provide comments is via the
  mailing list at <ulink url="mailto:blfs-dev@&lfs-domainname;"/>.</para>

  <para>Enjoy!</para>

  <para>Version 6.2.0 is the complement to the LFS 6.2 book. More time has
  elapsed between the release of the previous version (6.1) et this one than
  in any other release cycle. Much of this is due to the fact that LFS 6.2
  took much longer to be released than was originally anticipated. Many new
  packages have been introduced in the 6.2.0 version, as well as many
  updates, refinements et additions to the existing packages.</para>

  <para>The BLFS book now provides build et configuration instructions for
  almost 400 packages. Some of the new packages introduced in this version are:
  autotooled XOrg, HAL, D-BUS, GStreamer (now broken out into separate plugin
  packages), usbutils, libquicktime, GraphViz, K3b, dvd+rw-tools, NSS, Libidn,
  GAIM, Poppler, SeaMonkey, XChat, Audacious, cairo et unixODBC. Major updates
  include GNOME-2.14.3 (with several new GNOME packages such as Totem,
  gnome-mount et gnome-volume-manager), KDE-3.5.6, Firefox-1.5.x,
  Thunderbird-1.5.x, et most of the mainline server packages. As always, the
  list of packages that have been upgraded or added as well as configuration
  et build command changes are annotated in the
  <xref linkend="changelog"/>.</para>

  <para>Unfortunately, BLFS activity was semi-stagnant for several months
  after (and shortly before) the LFS 6.2 release. Therefore, many of the
  packages are somewhat dated (compared to previous BLFS versions). This
  brings us to why the versioning scheme has changed. This release is 6.2.0
  as we fully anticipate releasing another version (6.2.1) just as soon as
  possible. The 6.2.1 release will also be based on the LFS-6.2 book, but
  will include updated packages, et fixes for any errors which may be
  discovered in 6.2.0.</para>

  <para>As always, the main thrust of BLFS development will be to support
  the changes in the current LFS development book, but any changes or
  updates to the BLFS development book (that are compatible with LFS 6.2)
  will also be merged into the BLFS 6.2 branch. This way, a 6.2.1 version
  of BLFS should be released fairly soon, et should provide a very current
  et stable Linux platform.</para>

  <para>C'est la version de développement du livre BLFS. Cette version du livre vise à être
  utilisée avec une construction basée sur un système construit en utilisant la version de développement
  du livre LFS ainsi que la version stable de LFS. Bien que cette version du livre soit 
  par nature en développement, tous les efforts ont été faits pour garantir la
  sécurité et la fiabilité des instructions. La plupart des gens
  trouvent que l'utilisation des instructions de ce livre après
  la construction de la version de développement de LFS donne un système Linux
  stable et moderne.</para>

  <!--
  <para>Si vous avez construit LFS en utilisant une version stable (la plus récente étant
  LFS-6.3), vous ne voulez probablement pas utiliser cette version de BLFS, car il
  pourrait y avoir des incompatibilités. Utilisez plutôt la version de BLFS
  correspondante qui devrait être disponible sur tous les miroirs.</para>
