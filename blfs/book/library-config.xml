<para>As with most libraries, there is no configuration to do, save that
the library directory i.e. <userinput>/usr/lib</userinput> or
<userinput>/usr/local/lib</userinput> should appear in
<userinput>/etc/ld.so.conf</userinput> so that ldd can find the shared
libraries.  After checking that this is the case,
<userinput>/sbin/ldconfig</userinput> should be run whilst logged in as
root.</para>
