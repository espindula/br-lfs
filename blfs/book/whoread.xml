  <title>Who Would Want to Read this Book</title>

  <para>This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based
  on the LFS book. It will also be useful for those who are using other
  distributions, but for one reason or another want to manually build
  software and are in need of some assistance. Note that the material
  contained in this book, in particular the dependency listings, is based
  upon the assumption that you are using a base LFS system with every
  package listed in the LFS book already installed and configured. BLFS can
  be used to create a range of diverse systems and so the target audience is
  probably nearly as wide as that of the LFS book.  If you found LFS useful,
  you should also like this!</para>

  <para>Since Release 5.0, the BLFS book version matches the LFS book version.
  This book may be incompatible with a previous or latter release of the LFS
  book.</para>
