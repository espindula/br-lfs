<title>Audio utilities</title>

<para>This chapter contains programs involved with audio file
manipulation; that is to say playing, recording, ripping and the other
common things which people want to do.  To use much of this software,
you will require either the kernel sound drivers installed, or <xref
linkend="alsa"/> installed.  Note that in the 2.5 kernel development
tree, the old drivers are being replaced with ALSA and so when the
stable 2.6 series arrives; most people will be using it by
default.</para>
