<title>Command explanations</title>

<para><userinput>unset CFLAGS</userinput> : This command clears the
compile flags.  This command is optional, but the indications are that
the majority of installs will need it.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-freetype</userinput> : This command can be
added to the ./configure command to utilize freetype fonts instead of
the fonts provided by mplayer.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-gui</userinput> : This command needs to be
added to the ./configure command to compile the gui interface code. The
package maintainers consider this code 'alpha', therefore it is not
included in our default configuration.</para>

<para><userinput>cp etc/codecs.conf ~/.mplayer</userinput> : This
command copies the standard codecs.conf file to the user.  MPlayer
expects this file at startup.</para>

<para><userinput>cp etc/example.conf ~/.mplayer</userinput> : This
command copies the self documented configuration file to the user.  We
will create an new config file if you installed the gui or you can copy
this file to <filename>config</filename> and edit it for your
situation.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -sf /usr/share/mplayer/font/iso-8859-1/arial-14
~/.mplayer/font</userinput> : This command sets the default subtitle
font if you did not enable freetype.  All of the fonts are arial, but
they are available in sizes 14, 18, 24 and 28.  Replace the 14 in the
command above with the size of your choice.</para>
