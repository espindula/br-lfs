<para>The Xvid core package contains the library libxvidcore and the
appendant header files. The library itself provides functions to encode
and decode most mpeg4 video data.</para>

<para>Following features of mpeg4 are supported:</para>
<para><emphasis>I, P Frame encoding</emphasis></para>
<para>I-Frames are image frames, while P-Frames are Pattern Frames.
Image Frames contain full images. P-Frames contain patterns of what changes in
the image, thusly saving a lot of space.</para>
<para><emphasis>PMVFast and EPZS with diamond a sqare pattern motion 
estimation</emphasis></para>
<para>Fast Motion detection that can refer a square or diamond
shaped pattern to different directions.</para>
<para><emphasis>inter4v mode</emphasis></para>
<para>Fast interpolation ability.</para>
<para><emphasis>fullpixel and halfpixel precision</emphasis></para>
<para>Even halfpixel movements can be encoded. Better precision
results in better compression at better quality.</para>
<para><emphasis>both MPEG4 and H263 quantizations</emphasis></para>
<para>MPEG4 is the standard DivX was derived from. H263 is a
slightly changed subset of that standard made by Microsoft. Quantization
means to map the quantity of color values to numbers.</para>
<para><emphasis>custom quant matrices</emphasis></para>
<para>The quantization can be done using custom matrices,
possibly giving better results if the matrix is made to suit the video
data. Every normal user should be fine with the default matrix that comes
with Xvid.</para>
<para><emphasis>Adaptive quantization / Luminance masking</emphasis></para>
<para>Qantization and Luminance masking are variant, depending
on the input material, therefore providing better results on dark or very
contrasting images.</para>
