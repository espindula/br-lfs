<title>Multimedia Libraries et Drivers</title>

<para>Many multimedia programs require libraries et/or drivers in order 
to function properly.  The packages in this section fall into this category.
Generally you only need to install these if you are installing a program
which has the library listed as either a requirement, or as an option to
enable it to support certain functionality.</para>
