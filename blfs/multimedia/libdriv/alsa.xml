<para>The first question which people tend to ask about ALSA is why they
should use it over the sound drivers included in the kernel - there are
several reasons.  Firstly, the ALSA drivers support more sound cards
than those in the kernel.  Secondly, the OSS emulation is in some cases
faster and better than the original OSS driver itself.  And finally, there are
some programs which can use ALSA's enhanced features to better drive the
soundcard.</para>

<para>ALSA is also likely to be the future of Linux Sound (hence the
name <emphasis>Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</emphasis>), and the
ALSA drivers will probably be included into the main linux kernel at
some point during the 2.5 development series, leading eventually to ALSA
being the "standard" sound drivers into the future 2.6 stable
kernel.</para>

<para>The following five sections of the book deal with the five seperate
components of alsa: the drivers, the libraries, the utilities, the tools and
the OSS compatibility libraries.</para>
