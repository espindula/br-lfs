<para>There is software out there to look at /dev/sndstat to find out wether a
sound driver is installed. If you have such software sniggering at you
"no soundcard found", try the following (before giving up):</para>

<para><screen><userinput>rm /dev/sndstat
ln -s /proc/asound/sndstat /dev/sndstat</userinput></screen></para>

<title>Device permissions</title>

<para>If the software is complaining about having no access to the 
devices with your current UID, you need to set the proper permissions
(as root):</para>

<para><userinput>chmod a+rw /dev/mi* /dev/dsp* /dev/seq*</userinput>
This should do the job.</para>

<para>Alternatively, add your user to the <userinput>audio</userinput>
group and make sure the above <filename>/dev</filename> files are 
chgrp'd to the audio group and have group read and write access.</para>
