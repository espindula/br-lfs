<para>&lt;kernel-version&gt; should be replaced with your kernel version,
including any EXTRAVERSION such as -ac1 or -aa2.  If you are using a normal
kernel tarball, it will simply be the standard number (such as
2.4.19).</para>

<para>&lt;path-to-kernel-source-tree-to-build-for&gt; should be replaced
with the directory where the kernel source tree is for the version of the
kernel you wish to build for.  For example, if you want to build for kernel
2.4.19, it may be <filename
class="directory">/usr/src/linux-2.4.19</filename>.  This is needed because
the alsa drivers must be compiled against the correct version of the kernel
headers.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-sequencer=yes </userinput>: This tells the
alsa-driver package to build the sequencer modules for whichever soundcards
you are building for.  Most people want them so you will usually want to
leave it set to yes.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-oss=yes </userinput>: This tells the package to
build the OSS/Free emulation modules.  Again, most people want this so it's
probably best to stick with yes.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-isapnp=no </userinput>: Most sound cards these days
are PCI and so ISA Plug and Play support isn't needed.  If you are using an
ISA soundcard, it's best to say yes here.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-cards=... </userinput>: You can tell the script just
to build the drivers for your particular sound card here.  For full information
on which drivers are available see <userinput>./configure
--help</userinput>.  If you aren't sure which chipset your soundcard uses,
have a look in <filename>CARDS-STATUS</filename> in the alsa-driver source
tree.  If you want to build all drivers (for some reason) then
simply leave out the <userinput>--with-cards</userinput> statement
entirely.</para>
