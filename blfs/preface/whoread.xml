<title>Who would want to read this book</title>

<para>This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based
on the LFS book.  It will also be useful for those who are using other
distributions, but for one reason or another want to manually build
software and are in need of some assistance.  BLFS can be used to create
a range of diverse systems and so the target audience is probably nearly
as wide as that of the LFS book.  If you found LFS useful, you should
also like this!</para>
