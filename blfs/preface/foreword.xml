<title>Foreword</title>

<para>Having helped out with LinuxFromScratch for a short time, I
noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things beyond
the base LFS system.  At the time, the only assistance specifically
offered relating to LFS were the LFS hints (<ulink
url="&hints-root;">&hints-root;</ulink>).  Most of the LFS hints are
extremely good and well written but I (and others) could still see a
need for more comprehensive help to go Beyond LFS - hence BLFS.</para>

<para>BLFS aims to be more than the LFS-hints converted to XML although
much of our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors write
both hints and the relevant BLFS sections.  We hope that we can provide
you with enough information to not only manage to build your system up
to what you want, whether it be a web server or a multimedia desktop
system, but also that you will learn a lot about system configuration as
you go.</para>

<para>Thanks as ever go to everyone in the LFS/BLFS community especially
those who have contributed instructions, written text, answered
questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!</para>

<para>Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; 
ask questions on the mailing list or
news gateway and join in the fun on #lfs at irc.linuxfromscratch.org.
You can find more details about all of these in the <xref linkend="introduction"/> section of the book.</para>

<para>Enjoy using BLFS.</para>
