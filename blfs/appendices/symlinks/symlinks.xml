<title>List of rc?.d symlinks used in LFS/BLFS</title>

<para>This section lists all of the symlinks used by the lfs-bootscripts
package (correct as of version <userinput>1.9</userinput>) and all of
the scripts in the BLFS book.  This is for two reasons:  first, so that
you can see at a glance which number we have used for each package, and
second so that <emphasis>we</emphasis> can see which number we have
used for each package!  Without this, it would make our lives more
difficult (as we'd probably end up with conflicts).</para>

<para>It should go without saying that this is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
the only (or some would argue even optimal) setup for the symlinks.  In
the LFS tradition, you should find what suits <emphasis>you</emphasis>
and use that; our recommendations are only a template.</para>
