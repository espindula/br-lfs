<title>Using BLFS bootscripts</title>

<para>The scripts included for packages such as <xref linkend="gpm"/>
and <xref linkend="alsa"/> are based around the template supplied with
the lfs-bootscripts package from version 3.2 and later of the LFS book.
Note that this is lfs-bootscripts-1.6 and later (the old numbering
changed as of LFS-3.2).  The scripts won't work with versions of LFS
before 3.2 because of a change in their organisation with the new
scripts.  However, it should be trivial to adapt the scripts if needed
for older LFS versions.</para>
