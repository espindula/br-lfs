<title>Which sections of the book do I want?</title>

<para>Unlike the LinuxFromScratch book, BLFS isn't designed to be
followed in a linear manner.  This is because LFS provides instructions
on how to create a base system which is capable of turning into anything 
from a web server to a multimedia desktop system.  BLFS is where we try
to guide you through going from the base system to your intended
destination and so choice is very much involved.</para>

<para>MUCH OF THIS PAGE HAS TO BE RE-WRITTEN TO FIT THE NEW LAYOUT.  THE
OLD TEXT IS STILL IN THE XML SOURCE AND THE NEW TEXT CAN BE BASED ON
IT.</para>

<!-- THIS NEEDS REWRITING TO FIT THE NEW LAYOUT
<para>Everyone who reads the book will want to read certain sections.
<xref linkend="part1"/> which you are reading now contains generic
information.  Especially take note of the information 
in <xref linkend="chapter02"/> as this chapter contains comments about 
how to unpack software and various other aspects which apply 
throughout the book.</para>

<para>Most people will want to at least browse through <xref
linkend="part2"/> as this contains information on general post-LFS
configuration issues and information on various libraries which are
needed by many packages.  Note that you don't have to install all of
these libraries to start with, each BLFS install procedure tells you
which packages it depends upon so you can choose the program you want
to install and see what it needs.</para>

<para>Likewise, most people will probably want to look at <xref
linkend="chapter06"/> to deal with connecting to the Internet or your local
LAN.  The basic LFS book deals with setting up a static-ip based
ethernet connection, all other configurations such as DHCP and dial-up
internet connections are dealt with in this part of BLFS.</para>

<para>Once you have dealt with these basics, you may wish to configure
network services such as mail.  All of this is dealt with in the
remainder of <xref linkend="part3"/>.  Those wanting to build servers
should find enough information to give them a good starting point here.</para>

<para>Those creating desktop systems will want to look at the next three
parts of the book: <xref linkend="part4"/>, <xref linkend="part5"/> and
<xref linkend="part6"/>.</para>-->

<para>We hope you enjoy using BLFS and find it useful.</para>
