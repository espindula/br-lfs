<para>The Beyond LinuxFromScratch book is designed to carry on from
where the LFS book leaves off.  Unlike the LFS book, it isn't designed
to be followed straight through.  Reading the <xref
linkend="intro-welcome-whichsections"/> part of this chapter should
help guide you through the book.</para>

<para>Please read most of this part of the book carefully as it explains
quite a few of the conventions we use throughout the book.</para>
