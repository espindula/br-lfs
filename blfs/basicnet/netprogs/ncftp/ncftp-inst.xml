<title>Installation of ncftp</title>

<para>There are two ways to build ncftp.  The first (and optimal) way,
builds most of the functionality as a shared library and then builds and
installs the program linked against this library.  The second method
simply links all of the functionality into the binary statically.  This
doesn't make the dynamic library available for linking by other
applications.  You need to choose which method best suits you.  Note
that the second method does <emphasis>not</emphasis> create an entirely
statically linked binary; only the libncftp parts are statically linked
in, in this case.</para>

<para>To install ncftp using the first (and optimal) method, run the 
following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
cd libncftp &amp;&amp;
make shared &amp;&amp;
make soinstall &amp;&amp;
cd .. &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>To install ncftp using the second method (with the libncftp 
functionality linked in statically) run the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>
