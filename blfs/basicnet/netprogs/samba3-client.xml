  <title>Samba-&samba3-version; Client</title>

  <para>The <application>Samba</application> client utilities are used to
  transfer files to and from, mount SMB shares located on or use printers
  attached to Windows and other SMB servers. If you want to install these
  utilities, the instructions can be found in Chapter 21 &ndash;
  <xref linkend="samba3"/>. After performing the basic installation,
  configure the utilities using the configuration section titled
  <quote>Scenario 1: Minimal Standalone Client-Only Installation</quote>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you only want to use these client utilities, you do
  <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to run the server daemons and so do not need
  the startup script and links. In accordance with good practice, only run the
  server daemons if you actually need them. You'll find an explanation of the
  services provided by the server daemons in the <xref linkend="samba3"/>
  instructions.</para>
