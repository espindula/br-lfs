<para>Lynx is a text based web browser.</para>

<screen>lynx can use <xref linkend="openssl"></xref> and <xref linkend="zlib"></xref>.  
OpenSSL is needed in order to access HTTPS (i.e. secure) websites and so it is highly recommended that it is used.
Zlib is used by lynx for decompression of some gzip files.</screen>
