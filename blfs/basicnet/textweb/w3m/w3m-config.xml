<para>w3m expects the GPM library to be located at
<filename>/usr/lib/libgpm.so.1</filename>. To make w3m happy, we will
create a symbolic link to the GPM library. You only need to do this if
you compiled w3m with mouse support. To create this symbolic link, run
the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -sf /usr/lib/libgpm.so.?.* /usr/lib/libgpm.so.1</userinput></screen></para>

<title>Possible problems with GPM</title>

<para>Depending on what version of GPM you are using, and whether or not
any patches were applied to GPM, you might receive the following
warning when starting w3m:</para>

<para><screen>*** debug ***: [/usr/src/gpm-1.20.0/src/liblow.c(202)]:</screen></para>

<para>Currently, the only known solution to this problem is to disable
mouse support via the -no-mouse parameter. The origin of this problem is
currently unknown.</para>
