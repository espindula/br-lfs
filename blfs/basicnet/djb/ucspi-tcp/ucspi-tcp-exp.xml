These commands change the installation directory to /usr/sbin from the default 
of /usr/local/bin. Since these tools are used in conjuction with daemons, 
they don't make much sense in general user directories. However, some of the 
example programs and the tcpclient program might be of use to non-root users. 
If you wish to make these available, then we would suggest installing as above, 
and then executing the following commands: 
<screen><userinput>cd /usr/sbin</userinput>
<userinput>mv tcpclient *@ mconnect delcr addcr tcpcat /usr/bin</userinput></screen>This 
will place the client related programs into /usr/bin for general use.</para>
