<para>The ucspi-tcp package consists of a suite of tools that allow the easy 
creation of client-server tcp daemons. Tcpserver is a more secure alternative 
to inetd. It has built in functionality for rule based access control, and 
will gracefully defer connections when the configurable maximum load is reached,
unlike inetd. Tcpserver is also recommended for use with Qmail, and was 
written by the same author.</para>
