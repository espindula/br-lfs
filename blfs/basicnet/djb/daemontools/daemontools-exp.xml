<para>The first thing to understand in installing any package written 
by Daniel J. Bernstein, and 
this includes Qmail, djbdns and ucspi-tcp in addition to daemontools, is 
that he is willing to completely disregard standards if his idea of the 
correct thing to do differs from an particular standard. Professor 
Bernstein is a standards body unto himself when it comes to his own 
software. </para>

<para>It is therefore necessary to make quite a few changes to the 
installation commands for his packages to get them to install in a manner 
that is compliant with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). Most of 
the following commands are due to this difficulty.</para>

<para><userinput>cd admin/daemontools-0.76: </userinput>First off, the 
package is unpacked in an "admin" directory. You will find the actual 
packages two directory levels below this.</para>

<para><userinput>package/compile: </userinput>This command actually 
compiles the source and puts the binaries in a command directory.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>sed 's|command|usr/sbin|' boot.inittab &gt; boot.inittab~</userinput>
<userinput>mv boot.inittab~ boot.inittab</userinput></screen></para>
<para>These two commands are necessary to get the 
binaries installed in /usr/sbin rather than 
creating a non-standard /command directory and installing them there.
</para>

<para><screen><userinput>sed 's|/command:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:||' svscanboot &gt; svscanboot~</userinput>
<userinput>sed 's|/service|/etc/service|g' svscanboot~ &gt; svscanboot</userinput>
<userinput>rm svscanboot~</userinput></screen></para>
<para>This changes the svscanboot script so that it checks the 
/etc/service directory for daemons to run instead of the default 
/service directory.</para>

<para><userinput>cp * /usr/sbin: </userinput>We must manually copy the 
binaries to the /usr/sbin directory.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cat /etc/inittab boot.inittab &gt; /etc/inittab~</userinput>
<userinput>mv -f /etc/inittab~ /etc/inittab</userinput></screen></para>

<para>These commands append a line to /etc/inittab so that init will launch
the svscan program.</para>

<para><userinput>telinit Q: </userinput>This command tells the init 
process to re-read its configuration file (inittab) and act upon any 
changes that have been made.</para>

<para><userinput>mkdir /etc/service: </userinput>This command creates
the daemontools control directory, which needs to exist, even if empty
for daemontools to run properly.</para>
