  <title>Introduction Ã  KDE4</title>

  <para><application>KDE</application> in version 4 is a comprehensive
  desktop environment with a huge amount of applications written for it
  et also a huge amount of users. Subsequently, it is refered to 
  KDE version 4 as <application>KDE4</application>,
  et to KDE version 3 as <application>KDE3</application> to avoid 
  confusion in the versions.</para>

  <para><application>KDE3</application>, which is also in the book,
  isn't maintained anylonger by the KDE development team because there
  is the successor in form of <application>KDE4</application> out for
  years now. The current version is based on <application>Qt4</application> 
  et has some other conceptual innovations like the Plasmoids et
  Activities. For more information about this concepts go to the
  KDE project site at <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/"/>.</para>
