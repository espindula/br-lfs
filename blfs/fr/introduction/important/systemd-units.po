"The BLFS Systemd Units package will be used throughout the BLFS book for "
"systemd unit files. Each systemd unit has a separate install target.  It is "
"recommended that you keep the package source directory around until "
"completion of your BLFS system. When a systemd unit is requested from BLFS "
"Systemd Units, simply change to the directory, and as the <systemitem "
"class=\"username\">root</systemitem> user, execute the given <command>make "
"install-<replaceable>&lt;systemd-unit&gt;</replaceable></command> command. "
"This command installs the systemd unit to its proper location (along with "
"any auxiliary configuration scripts) and also enables it by default."
