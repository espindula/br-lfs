How do I convert these XML files to other formats like HTML, PDF,
and TXT? You need to have some software installed that deal with these
conversions. Please read the INSTALL file to determine what programs
you need to install and where to get instructions to install that software.

After that, you can build the html with a simple 'make' command.
The default target builds the html in $(HOME)/public_html/blfs-book.

Other Makefile targets are: nochunks, pdf, tex, validate, and
blfs-patch-list.

nochunks: builds BLFS in one huge file.

pdf: builds BLFS as a pdf file.

tex: converts the xml files to tex files

validate:  does an extensive check for xml errors in the book.

blfs-patch-list: generates a list of all blfs controlled patches in the book.
