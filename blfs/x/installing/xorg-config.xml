    <title>Creating an X11R6 Compatibility Symlink</title>

    <para>Until recently (relatively speaking) almost every
    <application>X Window</application> installation you performed or came
    across was installed in the
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> directory. That was the
    standard for years. Developers picked up on this et wrote their package
    installation scripts looking for <application>X</application> in the
    standard location. Things have changed et the trend is to now install
    <application>X</application> in
    <filename class='directory'>/usr</filename>. Some people want to install
    it in a custom location.</para>

    <para>Many package developers have not caught up to the change et their
    packages are still trying to find <application>X</application> in
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> et subsequently fail
    when you try to build the package. Though for most packages it is not
    difficult to 'hack' the installation script to fix the problem, that is not
    the long term solution to the problem. Upstream developers need to modernize
    their installation scripts et eliminate the problem altogether.</para>

    <para>Until then, you can create a symbolic link to satisfy the
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> requirement so that you
    won't be inconvenienced with a package build failure due to this known
    issue. If you wish to create the symlink, issue the following command as
    the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>&nbsp; (ensure you modify
    <replaceable>&lt;$XORG_PREFIX&gt;</replaceable> appropriately):</para>

      <title>Xft Font Protocol</title>

      <indexterm role="configuration" id=" fonts">
        <primary sortas="g-truetype">TrueType Fonts</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Xft provides antialiased font rendering through
      <application>Freetype</application>, et fonts are controlled from the
      client side using <application>Fontconfig</application>.  The default
      search path is <filename class="directory">/usr/share/fonts</filename>
      et <filename class="directory">~/.fonts</filename>.
      <application>Fontconfig</application> searches directories in its
      path recursively et maintains a cache of the font characteristics in
      <filename>fonts.cache-1</filename> files in each directory.  If the cache
      appears to be out of date, it is ignored, et information is (slowly)
      fetched from the fonts themselves.  This cache
      can be regenerated using the <command>fc-cache</command> command at any
      time. You can see the list of fonts known by
      <application>Fontconfig</application> by running the command
      <command>fc-list</command>.</para>

      <para>If you've installed <application>Xorg</application> in any prefix
      other than <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>, the
      <application>X</application> fonts were not installed in a
      location known to <application>Fontconfig</application>. This prevents
      <application>Fontconfig</application> from using the poorly rendered
      Type 1 fonts or the non-scalable bitmapped fonts. Symlinks were created
      from the <filename class="directory">OTF</filename> et <filename
      class="directory">TTF</filename> <application>X</application> font
      directories to <filename
      class="directory">/usr/share/fonts/X11-{OTF,TTF}</filename>. This allows
      <application>Fontconfig</application> to use the OpenType et TrueType
      fonts provided by <application>X</application> (which are scalable et
      of higher quality).</para>

      <para><application>Fontconfig</application> uses names such as
      "Monospace 12" to define fonts.  Applications generally use generic font
      names such as "Monospace", "Sans" et "Serif".
      <application>Fontconfig</application> resolves these names to a font that
      has all characters that cover the orthography of the language indicated
      by the locale settings.  Knowledge of these font names is included in
      <filename>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</filename>. Fonts that are not listed
      in this file are still usable by <application>Fontconfig</application>,
      but they will not be accessible by the generic family names.</para>

      <para>Standard scalable fonts that come with <application>X</application>
      provide very poor Unicode coverage.  You may notice in applications that
      use <application>Xft</application> that some characters appear as a box
      with four binary digits inside.  In this case, a font set with the
      available glyphs has not been found.  Other times, applications that
      don't use other font families by default et don't accept substitutions
      from <application>Fontconfig</application> will display blank lines when
      the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the user's language.
      This happens, e.g., with <application>Fluxbox</application> in the
      ru_RU.KOI8-R locale.</para>

      <para>In order to provide greater Unicode coverage, it is recommended
      that you install these fonts:</para>

          - This set of fonts covers nearly every non-CJK character, but is not
          visually pleasing.  <application>Fontconfig</application> will use it
          as a last resort to substitute generic font family names.</para>

          - These fonts provide slightly worse Unicode coverage than FreeFont,
          but are better hinted.  Be sure to read the license before using
          them. These fonts are listed in the aliases in the

      <para>The list above will not provide complete Unicode coverage.  For

      <para>As an example, consider the installation of the DejaVu fonts.  From
      the unpacked source directory, run the following commands as the
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>&nbsp;:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
install -v -m644 *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</userinput></screen>

  <sect2 role="configuration" id='xconfig'>
    <title>Setting up Xorg Devices</title>
    <para>For most hardware configurations, modern Xorg will automatically
    get the server configuration correct without any user intervention. There
    are, however, some cases where auto-configuration will be incorrect.
    Following are some example manual configuration items that may be of use in
    these instances.</para>

    <sect3 id="xinput">
    <title>Setting up X Input Devices</title>
    <para>For most input devices, no additional configuration will be
    necessary.  This section is provided for informational purposes only.</para>
    
    <para>A sample default XKB setup could look like the following (executed as
    the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>&nbsp;):</para>
<screen><userinput role="username">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xkb-defaults.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "XKB Defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "yes"
    Option "XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="xdisplay">
  <title>Fine Tuning Display Settings</title>
  <para>Again, with modern Xorg, little or no additional configuration is
  necessary. If you should need extra options passed to your video driver,
  for instance, you could use something like the following (again, executed as
  the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>&nbsp;):</para>

<screen><userinput role="root">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/videocard-0.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Videocard0"
    Driver      "radeon"
    VendorName  "Videocard vendor"
    BoardName   "ATI Radeon 7500"
    Option      "NoAccel" "true"
EndSection
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>Another common setup is having multiple server layouts for use in
  different environments. Though the server will automatically detect the
  presence of another monitor, it may get the order incorrect:</para>

<screen><userinput role="root">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/server-layout.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier     "DefaultLayout"
    Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
    Screen      1  "Screen1" LeftOf "Screen0"
    Option         "Xinerama"
EndSection
EOF</userinput></screen>
