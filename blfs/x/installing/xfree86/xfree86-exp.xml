<para><userinput>make World 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee xfree-compile.log &amp;&amp;</userinput>: 
This command runs multiple makefiles to completely rebuild the system.  
<userinput>2&gt;&amp;1</userinput> redirects error messages to the same location
as normal output. The <userinput>tee</userinput> command allows viewing of 
the output while logging the results to a file.</para>

<note><para>When rebuildng, a separate command that may be used if only minor 
changes are made to the sources is <userinput>make 
Everything</userinput>.  This does not automatically remove generated 
files and only rebuilds those files or programs that are out 
of date.</para></note>

<para><userinput>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/bin/X11</userinput>,
<userinput>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 /usr/lib/X11</userinput>, and
<userinput>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11</userinput>:
These commands are present to enable other (broken) packages to build
against XFree86.  We do this even though the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
says:
"In general, software must not be installed or managed via the above 
symbolic links. They are intended for utilization by users only."</para></sect2>
