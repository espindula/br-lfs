<title>Introduction</title>

<para>Window Mangers and Desktop Environments are the primary user
interfaces into the <application>X</application> Window System.  A window 
manager is a program that controls the appearance of windows and provides the 
means by which the user can interact with them.  A Desktop Environment 
provides a more complete interface to the operating system, and provides a 
range of integrated utilities and applications.</para>

<para>There are many Window Mangers available.  Some of the more well
known ones include <application>fvwm2</application>, <application>Window
Maker</application>, <application>AfterStep</application>,
<application>Enlightenment</application>,
<application>Sawfish</application>, 
and <application>Blackbox</application>.</para>

<para>The Desktop Environments available for Linux are
<application><acronym>GNOME</acronym></application>,
<application><acronym>KDE</acronym></application>, and
<application>XFce</application>.</para>

<para>Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective. 
The choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources 
(<acronym>RAM</acronym>, disk space) required, and the utilities included. 
One web site that provides a very good summary of what is available, 
screenshots, and their respective features is 
<ulink url="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/">Window Managers for X</ulink>.</para>

<para>In this chapter, the installation instructions of several Window 
Managers and one lightweight Desktop Environment are presented.  Later in the 
book, both <application><acronym>KDE</acronym></application> and
<application><acronym>GNOME</acronym></application> have their own
sections.</para>
