<title>Window Managers</title>

<para>Window Mangers et Desktop Environments are the primary user
interfaces into the X Windows System.  A window manager is a program 
that controls the appearance of windows et provides the means by which 
the user can interact with them.  A Desktop Environment provides a more 
complete interface to the operating system, et provides a range of 
integrated utilities et applications.</para>

<para>There are many Window Mangers available.  Some of the more well
known ones include fvwm2, Window Maker, AfterStep, Enlightenment, Sawfish, 
and Blackbox.</para>

<para>The Desktop Environments available for Linux are GNOME, KDE, et
XFce.</para>

<para>Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly 
subjective.  The choice depends on the look et feel of the packages, the 
resources (RAM, disk space) required, et the utilities included.  One web 
site that provides a very good summary of what is available, screenshots, 
and their respective features is <ulink 
url="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/">Window Managers for X</ulink>.</para>

<para>In this chapter, the installation instructions of
several Window Managers are presented.  Later in the book, both KDE et
Gnome have their own Parts.</para>
