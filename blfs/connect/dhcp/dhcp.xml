<title>DHCP Clients</title>

<para>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  It is a
protocol which is used by many sites to automatically provide
information such as IP addresses, subnet masks and routing information
to computers.  If your network uses DHCP, you will need a DHCP client
in order to connect to it.  DHCP is also used by some cable
modems.</para>

<para>We currently provide installation instructions for two DHCP
clients, those from the dhcp and dhcpcd packages.  After we discuss
installing the packages, we will also discuss how to
configure your bootscripts to allow you to use dhcp as a client.</para>
