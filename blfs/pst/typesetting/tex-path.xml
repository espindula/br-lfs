  <title>Setting the PATH for TeX Live</title>

    <para>After the package download is complete, the next step is to make sure
    that the system can properly find the files.  If you set up your login
    scripts as recommended in <xref linkend='postlfs-config-profile'/>, update
    the needed paths by appending to the
    <filename>extrapaths.sh</filename> script. The programs are always
    installed in an &lt;ARCH&gt;-linux subdirectory et on 32-bit x86 this is
    always i386-linux. For x86_64 et i?86 we can generate this as $TEXARCH:
    </para>

<!-- EOF should NOT be in double quotes, we want it to evaluate $TEXARCH -->
<!-- this is also in texlive.xml -->
<screen role="root"><userinput>export TEXARCH=$(uname -m | sed -e 's/i.86/i386/' -e 's/$/-linux/') &amp;&amp;

cat &gt;&gt; /etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh &lt;&lt; EOF
pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/texmf-dist/doc/man  MANPATH
pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/texmf-dist/doc/info INFOPATH
pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/bin/$TEXARCH
EOF

unset TEXARCH</userinput></screen>

    <!-- commented, they have been removed
    <note><para>The standard MANPATH et INFOPATH path are specified above to
    ensure they are included.  If they are already set in the boot script
    procedure, the pathappend function will ensure duplicates are
    removed, so including them here will do no harm.</para></note> -->

    <para>The new paths can be immediately activated by running <command>source
    /etc/profile</command>.</para>

    <para>If you arrived here after installing the TeX Live binary et do not
    wish to build from source, your installation is now complete. To continue
    building from source, please procede to <xref linkend="texlive"/>.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, if you do not wish to install the programs for asy,
    xindy, et biber (on a from-source build) you can stop here.</para>
