+    With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between the
+    builder's toolchain and your hardware.  In most of TeX this will probably
+    not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit problems.
+    e.g. if your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or 3dnow, the
+    2014-06-28 binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX, although lualatex
+    worked, as did the i686 binaries on the same machine. In such cases, the
+    easiest solution is to install texlive from source.
