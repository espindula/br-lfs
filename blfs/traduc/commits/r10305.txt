-  <para><application>Xorg</application>-&xorg7-version; introduces a completely
-  autotooled build system which means that the packages build and install
-  using the conventional <command>configure</command>, <command>make</command>
-  and <command>make install</command> commands, but it requires installing
-  more than 100 different packages. Most large commercial distributions have

+  <para><application>Xorg</application>, in addition to clearing up some
+  licensing issues with <ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</ulink>,
+  introduced a completely autotooled build for the X Window system. This
+  means that the packages build and install using the conventional
+  <command>configure</command>, <command>make</command> and <command>make
+  install</command> commands, as opposed to a proprietary build system that
+  requied hand editing of configuration parameters in a C-like syntax.</para>
 
+  <para><application>Xorg</application> also brought with it a modular build
+  system. While this separation into modules resulted in full control of the
+  features available to the X server on any given installation, it also made
+  the installation more tedious as it requires installing more than 100
+  different packages to obtain a functional X Window environment. Most large
+  commercial distributions have elected to use <application>Xorg</application>
+  over the <application>XFree86</application> distribution due to both
+  licensing issues and the increased functionality provided by it over
+  <application>XFree86</application>.</para>
