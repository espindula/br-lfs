       <application>Lua</application> is a powerful light-weight programming
       language designed for extending applications. It is also frequently used
       as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. <application>Lua</application>
-combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
-constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. It is
-dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory
-management with garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration,
-scripting, and rapid prototyping. A fundamental concept in the design of
-<application>Lua</application> is to provide meta-mechanisms for
-implementing features, instead of providing a host of features directly in
-the language. For example, although <application>Lua</application> is not
-a pure object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for
-implementing classes and inheritance. <application>Lua</application>'s
-meta-mechanisms bring an economy of concepts and keep the language small,
-while allowing the semantics to be extended in unconventional ways.
-Extensible semantics is a distinguishing feature of
-<application>Lua</application>. <application>Lua</application> is a
-language engine that you can embed into your application. This means that,
-besides syntax and semantics, it has an API that allows the application to
-exchange data with <application>Lua</application> programs and also to
-extend <application>Lua</application> with C functions. In this sense, it
-can be regarded as a language framework for building domain-specific
-languages. <application>Lua</application> is implemented as a small
-library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all
-known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency,
-portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine
-with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.
