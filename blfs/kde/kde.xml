<para>There are two versions of <application>KDE</application>. KDE4
is a mature version that combines libraries and the desktop environment
into one set of packages and has numerous appplications that can be
built on that base.  For KDE5, the libraries, now called KDE Frameworks
5 or KF5, are separate from the desktop environment called KDE Plasma 5.
Both envionments can be installed, but Plasma is not yet considered 
stable.</para>
