<screen>KDE depends on: <xref linkend="xfree86"/> and <xref linkend="qt"/></screen>
</para>

<para>KDE is a comprehensive desktop environment that builds on 
<productname>XFree86</productname> and <productname>QT</productname> to provide
a window manager and many user tools, including a browser, word processor, 
spreadsheet, persentation package, games, and numerous other utilities.  It 
provides extensive capabilites for customization.</para>

<para>We divide the KDE instructions into three parts.  Firstly, the
core packages which you need for the rest of KDE to work.  Secondly,
additional packages which provide functionality in various areas
(multimedia, graphics etc) and finally, other KDE packages.</para>

<para>KDE also has many internationalization packages in the form of:
<userinput>kde-i18n-xx-&kde-version;.tar.bz2</userinput>
where the xx is a two to five letter code for the country covered.  We
do not cover the installation of these packages here.</para>
