<para><userinput>--noninteractive :</userinput> This switch is used to
avoid the configuration routine asking for confirmation of the
directories to install to (which we pass using switches to configure
anyways).</para> 

<para><userinput>--with-GCOPTS="$CFLAGS" :</userinput> This switch
causes libtiff to be built using the options we have set in $CFLAGS
(which most other packages handle automatically).</para>

<para><userinput>--with-DIR_MAN=/usr/share/man :</userinput> This is
used because despite the fact we pass --prefix=/usr, the configure
routine tries to install the man-pages in /usr/local/man instead of the
correct place.</para>
