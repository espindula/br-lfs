<para><userinput>CC="gcc $CFLAGS" :</userinput> This makes libpng use
CFLAGS when compiling.</para>

<para><userinput>ZLIBINC=/usr/include ZLIBLIB=/usr/lib
:</userinput> This forces libpng to look for the zlib includes and
libraries where we have them installed.</para>

<para><userinput>-f scripts/makefile.linux :</userinput> This points
make at the the Linux version of the makefile as libpng doesn't use a
