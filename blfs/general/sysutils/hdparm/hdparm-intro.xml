<para>The hdparm package contains the hdparm utility.  This is useful
for controlling ATA/IDE controllers and hard drives both to increase
performance and sometimes to increase stability.</para>

<para><emphasis>WARNING!</emphasis> As well as being useful, incorrect
usage of hdparm can destroy your information and in rare cases, drives.
Use with caution and make sure you know what you are doing.  If in
doubt, we recommend you leave the default kernel parameters
alone.</para>
