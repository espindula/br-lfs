<para>Gpm (the general purpose mouse daemon) is a mouse server for
applications running in the console.  It not only provides cut and paste
support generally, but its library component is used by various software
such as links to provide mouse support to the application generally.  It
is useful on desktops, especially if following (Beyond)LinuxFromScratch
instructions - it's often much easier (and less error prone) to cut and
paste between two console windows than to type everything by
hand!</para>
