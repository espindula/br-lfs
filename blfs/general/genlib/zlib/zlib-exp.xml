<para>The reason we run the ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install routine twice is because zlib's configure routine is nicely
broken meaning that we can't compile and install the shared and static
libraries at the same time.  Therefore, we have to do them separately.</para>

<para>We do <userinput>cp zlib.3 /usr/share/man/man3</userinput> because
zlib doesn't install its man page correctly.</para>
