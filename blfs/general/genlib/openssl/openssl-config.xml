<para>Most people who just want to use openssl for providing functions
to other programs such as OpenSSH and web browsers won't need to worry
about configuring openssl.  Configuring openssl is an advanced topic and
so those who do would normally be expected to either know how to do it
or to be able to find out how to do it.</para>
