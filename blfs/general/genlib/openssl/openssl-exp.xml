<para><userinput>mv doc/apps/passwd.pod
doc/apps/openssl-passwd.pod :</userinput> We do this because otherwise
openssl installs it's passwd man page over the existing system one which
isn't what we want.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make MANDIR=/usr/share/man</userinput>
<userinput>make MANDIR=/usr/share/man install :</userinput></screen> These
commands install openssl with the man pages in /usr/share/man instead of
the default which is /etc/ssl/man.</para>
 
<para><userinput>rmdir /etc/ssl/lib :</userinput> This is simply a
tidy-up command.  For some reason, the openssl install routine creates
the /etc/ssl/lib directory even though the libraries have been installed
in /usr/lib.  We remove it to keep things nice and tidy!</para>
