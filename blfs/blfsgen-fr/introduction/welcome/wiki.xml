  <title>Editor Notes</title>

  <para>The BLFS Project has created a Wiki for editors to comment on pages and
instructions at <ulink url='&blfs-wiki;'/>.</para>

  <para>When <emphasis>editor notes</emphasis> are present, a link appears in the
form <literal>&blfs-wiki;/pkgname</literal> right below the dependency
list. The idea behind the editor notes is to give additional information
about the package and/or its build instructions, common pitfalls or maybe
even more sophisticated configuration for special cases of use.</para>

  <para>The vast majority of the packages do not have editor notes.</para>
  
  <note>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>editor notes</emphasis> might be outdated. Even though the
pages should be reviewed when a package is updated, it might happen that
there are notes referring to an obsolete version and therefore, the notes
might be out of date. Always check the date of the notes and more
importantly, the version of the package the notes refer to.
