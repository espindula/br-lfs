  <para>
    This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based on the LFS
book. It will also be useful for those who are using other distributions,
and for one reason or another want to manually build software and need some
assistance. Note that the material in this book, in particular the
dependency listings, assumes that you are using a basic LFS system with
every package listed in the LFS book already installed and configured. BLFS
can be used to create a range of diverse systems and so the target audience
is probably as wide as that of the LFS book.  If you found LFS useful, you
should also like this!

  <para>
    Since Release 7.4, the BLFS book version has matched the LFS book version.
This book may be incompatible with a previous or later release of the LFS
book.
