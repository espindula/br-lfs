How do I convert these XML files to HTML? You need to have some software
installed that deal with these conversions. Please read the INSTALL file to
determine what programs you need to install and where to get instructions to
install that software.

After that, you can build the html with a simple 'make' command.
The default target builds the html in $(HOME)/public_html/blfs-book.

For all targets, setting the parameter REV=systemd is needed to build the
systemd version of the book.

Other Makefile targets are: nochunks, validate, and blfs-patch-list.

nochunks: builds BLFS in one huge file.

validate:  does an extensive check for xml errors in the book.

blfs-patch-list: generates a list of all blfs controlled patches in the book.
