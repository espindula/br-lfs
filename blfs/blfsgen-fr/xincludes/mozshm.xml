<para>
      If you are compiling this package in chroot you must do two things.  First,
as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, ensure that
<filename>/dev/shm</filename> is mounted. If you do not do this, the
<application>Python</application> configuration will fail with a traceback
report referencing
<filename>/usr/lib/pythonN.N/multiprocessing/synchronize.py</filename>.
Run: <screen role="nodump"><userinput>mountpoint -q /dev/shm || mount -t tmpfs devshm /dev/shm</userinput></screen>
