<para role="recommended">
  <xref role="runtime" linkend="python2"/> is used by many scripts - most are
unmaintained. Many invoke <filename>/usr/bin/env python</filename>, a couple
invoke <filename>/usr/bin/python</filename>. It is not generally known if
these will work with a symlink to <command>python3</command> (as used in
some distros) and two from pythontex invoke <command>python2</command>.
<xref role="runtime" linkend="ruby"/> is used by some scripts, mostly within
mtx_context which is part of <application>conTeXt</application>, but also
for one or two others, such as match_parens, which are generally useful.
The perl module <ulink
url="https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/S/SR/SREZIC/Tk-804.035.tar.gz">Tk</ulink>,
which needs to be run from an X11 session to run the tests and requires
<xref role="runtime" linkend="tk"/>, is used by one of the scripts for ptex
(Japanese vertical writing), can be used by a conTeXt texfind script, and is
needed for texdoctk (a GUI interface for finding documentation files and
opening them with the appropriate viewer).
