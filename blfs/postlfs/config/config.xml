<title>After LFS Configuration Issues</title>

<para>The intention of LFS is to provide a basic system which you can
build upon.  There are several things which many people wonder about to
do with tidying up their system once they have done the base install.
We hope to cover these issues in this chapter.</para>

<para>Most people coming from a Windows background to Linux find the
concept of text-only configuration files slightly strange.  In Linux,
just about all configuration is done via text files.  The majority of
these files can be found in the <filename>/etc</filename> hierarchy.
There are often graphical configuration programs available for different
subsystems but these are mostly simply pretty frontends to the process
of editing the file.  The advantage of text-only configuration is that
you can edit parameters using your favourite text editor, whether that
be vim, emacs or anything else.</para>
