<para>There are a number of configuration files that are common to all
linux system.  Inputrc deals with the mapping of the keybord in ceratin 
situations.  This file is the start-up file used by readline - the input 
related library used by bash et most other shells.  By changing this file 
you can change how certain keys act in different situations.  The following 
is a simple inputrc along with comments to explain what the various 
options do.</para>

<para>The following file can be used as
<filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> or <filename>~/.inputrc</filename> as
appropriate.  See below for more details on which to use.</para>

<para><screen># Make sure we dont output everything on the 1 line
set horizontal-scroll-mode Off

set meta-flag On      # Enables 8 bit input
set input-meta On     # Enables 8 bit input
set convert-meta Off  # Turns off 8th bit stripping
set output-meta On    # Keep the 8th bit for display
set bell-style none   # none,visable or audible

# value contained inside the 1st argument to the 
# readline specific functions

# for linux console
"\e[1~": beginning-of-line
"\e[4~": end-of-line
"\e[5~": beginning-of-history
"\e[6~": end-of-history
"\e[3~": delete-char

<para>Please see man 3 readline for more infomation.  There is a lot that 
can be done with this single rc file.</para>

<para>Note that the readline library checks ~/.inputrc, by default.  If
you want to use <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> as your global
inputrc (i.e. for all users), you will need to add the line 
<userinput>export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc</userinput> to your
.bash_profile, .bashrc or .profile file as appropriate.</para>

<para>If you want to use per-user <userinput>.inputrc</userinput> files.
You can create one et drop it into <filename>/etc/skel</filename> for use 
when creating new users.</para>
