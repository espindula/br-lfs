  <title>Ext3</title>

  <para>Ext3 is a journaling file system that is an extension to the ext2
  file system. It is backward compatible with ext2 et the conversion from
  ext2 to ext3 is trivial.</para>

  <para>You don't need to install anything to use ext3, all the required
  packages are available with a bare LFS system.</para>

  <para>When building the kernel, ensure that you have compiled in ext3
  support.  If you want your root partition to be ext3, then compile the ext3
  support in the kernel, else you may compile it as a module. Recompile the
  kernel if needed.</para>

  <para>Edit your <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. For each partition that you
  want to convert into ext3, edit the entry so that it looks similar to the
  following line.</para>

<screen><literal>/dev/hd<replaceable>&lt;XX&gt;</replaceable> /mnt_point ext3 defaults 1 1</literal></screen>

  <para>In the above line, replace
  <filename>/dev/hd<replaceable>&lt;XX&gt;</replaceable></filename> by the
  partition (e.g., <filename>/dev/hda2</filename>),
  <filename class="directory">/mnt_point</filename> by the mount point (e.g.,
  <filename class="directory">/home</filename>). The <option>1</option> in the
  last field ensures that the partition will be checked for
  consistency during the boot process  by the <command>checkfs</command> script
  as recommended by the maintainer.
  You may replace the <option>ext3</option> fs type in the above by
  <option>auto</option> if you want to ensure that the partition is mounted
  even if you accidentally disable ext3 support in the kernel.</para>

  <para>For each partition that you have converted to ext3 in <filename>
  /etc/fstab</filename>, enable the journal for the partition by running the
  following command.</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>tune2fs -j /dev/hd<replaceable>&lt;XX&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Remount the concerned partitions, or simply reboot if you have
  recompiled the kernel to enable ext3 support.</para>

  <para>More information is available at <ulink
  url="http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/ext3/ext3-usage.html"/>. This
  information is still relevant to the 2.6 kernels.</para>
