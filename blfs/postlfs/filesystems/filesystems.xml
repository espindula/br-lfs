  <title>File Systems</title>

  <para>Journaling file systems reduce the time needed to recover a
  file system that was not unmounted properly.  While this can be extremely
  important in reducing downtime for servers, it has also become popular for
  desktop environments.  This chapter contains two other journaling file
  systems you can use instead of the default LFS third extended file
  system.</para>
