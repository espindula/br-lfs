<para>This document is meant as an introduction to how to setup a
firewall - it is not a complete guide to securing systems.  Firewalling
is a complex issue that requires careful configuration.
The scripts quoted here are simply intended to give examples as to how
firewalling works, they are not intended to fit into any imaginable 
configuration and may not prevent any imaginable attack.</para>

<para>The purpose of this text is simply to give you a hint on how to get
started with firewalling.</para>

<para>Customization of these scripts for your specific situation will
be necessary for an optimal configuration, but you should make a serious
study of the iptables documentation and firewalling in general before hacking
away.  Have a look at the list of <xref linkend="postlfs-security-fw-library"/> at the end 
of this section for more details.  Here you will find a list of URLs that 
contain quite comprehensive information about building your own firewall.</para>
