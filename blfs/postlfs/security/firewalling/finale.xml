<title>Editor's Note</title>

<para>Finally, I'd like to remind you of one fact we must not forget:
The effort spent attacking a system corresponds to the value the cracker
expects to gain from it.
If you are responsible for such valuable assets that you expect great
effort to be made by potential crackers, you hopefully won't be in the 
need of this hint!</para>

<para><literallayout>Be cautious!

<para>PS: And always do remember:
SecureIT is not a matter of a status-quo but one of never stopping 
to take care!</para>

<para>PPS: If any of these scripts fail, please tell me. I will try to trace 
any faults.</para>
