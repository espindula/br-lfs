  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare
  for building the temporary system. We will create a set of directories in
  <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename> (in which we will install the
  temporary tools), add an unprivileged user,
  and create an appropriate build environment for that user. We will also
  explain the units of time (<quote>SBUs</quote>) we use to measure how
  long it takes to build LFS packages, and provide some information about package
  test suites.</para>
