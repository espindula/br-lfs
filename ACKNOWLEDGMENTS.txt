Specials acknowledgments by the Translator:

- to my beloved wife Maria do Carmo Espindula for her patience towards 
me and the many hours of living together sacrificed to invest in this 
translator's project;

- to Alberto Senna Dias Neto, translator of the version 7.5 of the book 
"Linux From Scratch". Some pages had almost been fully borrowed from his 
translator's effort. <https://sourceforge.net/projects/lfsptbr/>
