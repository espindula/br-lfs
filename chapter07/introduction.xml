  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary
  system: the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages.  Now
  that all circular dependencies have been resolved, a <quote>chroot</quote>
  environment, completely isolated from the host operating system (except for
  the running kernel), can be used for the build.</para>

  <para>For proper operation of the isolated environment, some communication
  with the running kernel must be established. This is done through the
  so-called <emphasis>Virtual Kernel File Systems</emphasis>, which must be
  mounted when entering the chroot environment. You may want to check
  that they are mounted by issuing <command>findmnt</command>.</para>

  <para>Until <xref linkend="ch-tools-chroot"/>, the commands must be
  run as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, with the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable set. After entering chroot, all commands
  are run as &root;, fortunately without access to the OS of the computer
  you built LFS on. Be careful anyway, as it is easy to destroy the whole
  LFS system with badly formed commands.</para>
