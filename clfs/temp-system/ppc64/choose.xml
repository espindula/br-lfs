  <para>Powerpc64 is slightly different from some of the other
  architectures, because a 64-bit kernel running 32-bit userspace can
  successfully chroot and execute 64-bit programs.  However, if the
  kernel personality has been set to 32-bit by a utility such as
  linux32, it will eventually fail when glibc thinks it is building
  on a 32-bit system and tries to include incompatible assembler code
  in the 64-bit glibc.</para>

  <para>To see if you can successfully chroot to build the final powerpc64
  system, enter the following command which tests if you are running a
  64-bit Linux 2.6 kernel (with a 64-bit personality):</para>

<screen><userinput>uname -a | grep '^Linux.*2\.6\..*ppc64' &amp;&amp; \
    echo "ok to chroot" || echo "you must boot"</userinput></screen>
