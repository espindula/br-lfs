  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare
  for building the cross-compile tools. We will create directories in
  <filename class="directory">${CLFS}</filename> for the installation of the
  cross-toolchain and temporary system, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk,
  and create an appropriate build environment for that user.</para>
