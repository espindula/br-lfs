  <title>About the Test Suites</title>

  <para>Most packages provide a test suite, usually a script or
  <command>make</command> target, which tests the just-compiled programs or
  libraries by executing or linking to them. Test suites are often useful
  for verifying that a package compiled correctly. However, they cannot
  be run while cross-compiling so we will not mention test suite commands
  for any packages until <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>.</para>
