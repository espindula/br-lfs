  <title>Creating the ${CLFS}/cross-tools Directory</title>

  <para>The cross-binutils and cross-compiler built in
  <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> will be installed under
  <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/cross-tools</filename> to keep them
  separate from the host programs. The programs compiled here are
  cross-tools and will not be a part of the final CLFS system or the
  temp-system. By keeping these programs in a separate directory, they
  can easily be discarded later after their use.</para>

  <para>Create the required directory by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}/cross-tools</userinput></screen>

  <para>The next step is to create a <filename
  class="symlink">/cross-tools</filename> symlink on the host system.
  This will point to the newly-created directory on the CLFS partition.
  Run this command as  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> as well:</para>

<screen><userinput>ln -sv ${CLFS}/cross-tools /</userinput></screen>
