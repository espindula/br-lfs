  <title>Creating the ${CLFS}/tools Directory</title>

  <para>All programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-temp-system"/>
  will be installed under <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/tools</filename>
  to keep them separate from the programs compiled in <xref
  linkend="chapter-building-system"/>. The programs compiled here are
  temporary tools and will not be a part of the final CLFS system. By keeping
  these programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later
  after their use. This also prevents these programs from ending up in the
  host production directories (easy to do by accident in <xref
  linkend="chapter-temp-system"/>).</para>

  <para>Create the required directory by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}/tools</userinput></screen>

  <para>The next step is to create a <filename class="symlink">/tools</filename>
  symlink on the host system. This will point to the newly-created directory
  on the CLFS partition. Run this command as <systemitem
  class="username">root</systemitem> as well:</para>

<screen><userinput>ln -sv ${CLFS}/tools /</userinput></screen>

  <note>
    <para>The above command is correct. The <command>ln</command> command
    has a few syntactic variations, so be sure to check <command>info
    coreutils ln</command> and <filename>ln(1)</filename> before reporting
    what you may think is an error.</para>
  </note>

  <para>The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so that
  it always refers to <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>,
  meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will work. This will
  provide a common place for our temporary tools system.</para>
