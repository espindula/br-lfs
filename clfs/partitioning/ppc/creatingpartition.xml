  <para os="c1">Open Firmware and the Mac OS's impose certain requirements on
  partitioning.  This is discussed in <xref linkend="appendixe" role="."/>.
  In particular, you cannot use <command>fdisk</command>, you will need an
  <literal>apple_bootstrap</literal> partition, and that should precede any
  OSX partition.</para>

  <para os="d">Start a disk partitioning program such as <command>parted</command>
  with a command line option naming the hard
  disk on which the new partition will be created&mdash;for example
  <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda</filename> for the primary
  Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create at least an apple bootstrap
  partition, a Linux native partition, and a swap partition, if needed. Please
  refer to <filename>parted(8)</filename> if you do not yet know how to use the
  programs.</para>

  <para os="e">Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g.,
  <filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename>). This book will refer to
  this as the CLFS partition. Also remember the designation of the swap
  partition. These names will be needed later for the
  <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file. You will also need to know the
  designation of the apple_bootstrap partition for the <filename>yaboot.conf
  </filename> when you set this up before you run <command>ybin</command>.</para>
