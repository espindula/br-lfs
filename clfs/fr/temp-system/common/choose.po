"There are two different ways you can proceed from this point to build the "
"final system. You can build a kernel, a bootloader, and a few other "
"utilities, boot into the temporary system, and build the rest "
"there. Alternatively, you can mount a few virtual filesystems and chroot "
"into the temporary system."

"The <command>chroot</command> (change root) program is used to enter a "
"virtual environment and start a new shell whose root directory will be set "
"to the CLFS partition. This is very similar to rebooting and instructing the "
"kernel to mount the CLFS partition as the root partition.  The major "
"advantage is that <quote>chrooting</quote> allows the builder to continue "
"using the host while CLFS is being built. While waiting for package "
"compilation to complete, a user can switch to a different virtual console "
"(VC) or X desktop and continue using the computer as normal."

"The main downside to chrooting is that you are more limited in when you can "
"use it - booting will always work for any CLFS build, but the chroot method "
"can only be used when you are building on the same architecture. For "
"example, if you are building on, and for, an x86 system, you can simply "
"chroot. Booting is required when you are compiling for a different "
"architecture, such as building a PowerPC system from an x86. The rule of "
"thumb here is that if the architectures match and you are running the same "
"series kernel (specifically, a &glibc-kernel-version; or newer Linux kernel) "
"you can just chroot. If you aren't running the same series kernel, or are "
"wanting to run a different ABI, you will need to use the boot option."
