"The CLFS system will be built by using a previously installed Unix system or "
"Linux distribution (such as Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, or Ubuntu). This "
"existing system (the host) will be used as a starting point to provide "
"necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and shell, to build the "
"new system. Select the <quote>development</quote> option during the "
"distribution installation to be able to access these tools."

"As an alternative to installing an entire separate distribution onto your "
"machine, you may wish to use a livecd. Most distributions provide a livecd, "
"which provides an environment to which you can add the required tools onto, "
"allowing you to successfully follow the instructions in this book. Remember "
"that if you reboot the livecd you will need to reconfigure the host "
"environment before continuing with your build."

"<xref linkend=\"chapter-partitioning\"/> of this book describes how to "
"create a new Linux native partition and file system, the place where the new "
"CLFS system will be compiled and installed. <xref "
"linkend=\"chapter-getting-materials\"/> explains which packages and patches "
"need to be downloaded to build a CLFS system and how to store them on the "
"new file system. <xref linkend=\"chapter-final-preps\"/> discusses the setup "
"for an appropriate working environment. Please read <xref "
"linkend=\"chapter-final-preps\"/> carefully as it explains several important "
"issues the developer should be aware of before beginning to work through "
"<xref linkend=\"chapter-cross-tools\"/> and beyond."

"<xref linkend=\"chapter-cross-tools\"/> explains the installation of "
"cross-compile tools which will be built on the host but be able to compile "
"programs that run on the target machine. These cross-compile tools will be "
"used to create a temporary, minimal system that will be the basis for "
"building the final CLFS system. Some of these packages are needed to resolve "
"circular dependencies&mdash;for example, to compile a compiler, you need a "
"compiler."

"The process of building cross-compile tools first involves building and "
