"Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>CLFS</envar> will be "
"used several times. You should ensure that this variable is always defined "
"throughout the CLFS build process. It should be set to the name of the "
"directory where you will be building your CLFS system - we will use "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/mnt/clfs</filename> as an example, but the "
"directory choice is up to you. If you are building CLFS on a separate "
"partition, this directory will be the mount point for the partition.  Choose "
"a directory location and set the variable with the following command:"
