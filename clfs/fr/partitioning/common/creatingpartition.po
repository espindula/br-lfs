"Like most other operating systems, CLFS is usually installed on a dedicated "
"partition. The recommended approach to building a CLFS system is to use an "
"available empty partition or, if you have enough unpartitioned space, to "
"create one. However, if you're building for a different architecture you can "
"simply build everything in <quote>/mnt/clfs</quote> (or whatever directory "
"you want to use) and transfer it to your target machine. If you do not plan "
"to use a separate partition for building CLFS, you can skip the rest of this "
"chapter and continue on to <xref linkend=\"chapter-getting-materials\"/>."

"A minimal system requires around 6 gigabytes (GB).  This is enough to store "
"all the source tarballs and compile the packages. The CLFS system itself "
"will not take up this much room. A large portion of this requirement is to "
"provide sufficient free temporary storage. Compiling packages can require a "
"lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the package is installed. If "
"the CLFS system is intended to be the primary Linux system, additional "
"software will probably be installed which will require additional space "
"(2-10 GB)."

"Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)  available for "
"compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as "
"swap space. This is used by the kernel to store seldom-used data and leave "
"more memory available for active processes. The swap partition for a CLFS "
"system can be the same as the one used by the host system, in which case it "
"is not necessary to create another one."

"As the <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> user, start a disk "
"partitioning program such as <command>cfdisk</command> or "
"<command>fdisk</command> with a command line option naming the hard disk on "
"which the new partition will be created&mdash;for example <filename "
"class=\"devicefile\">/dev/sda</filename> for the primary Integrated Drive "
"Electronics (IDE) or Serial ATA (SATA) disk. Create a Linux native partition "
"and a swap partition, if needed. Please refer to "
"<filename>cfdisk(8)</filename> or <filename>fdisk(8)</filename> if you do "
"not yet know how to use the programs."

"Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <filename "

"CLFS partition. Also, remember the designation of the swap partition. These "
