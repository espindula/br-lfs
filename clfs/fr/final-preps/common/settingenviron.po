"When logged on as user <systemitem class=\"username\">clfs</systemitem>, the "
"initial shell is usually a <emphasis>login</emphasis> shell which reads the "
"<filename>/etc/profile</filename> of the host (probably containing some "
"settings and environment variables) and then "
"<filename>.bash_profile</filename>. The <command>exec env "
"-i.../bin/bash</command> command in the <filename>.bash_profile</filename> "
"file replaces the running shell with a new one with a completely empty "
"environment, except for the <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>TERM</envar>, and "
"<envar>PS1</envar> variables.  This ensures that no unwanted and potentially "
"hazardous environment variables from the host system leak into the build "
"environment. The technique used here achieves the goal of ensuring a clean "
"environment."

"The <command>set +h</command> command turns off <command>bash</command>'s "

"feature&mdash;<command>bash</command> uses a hash table to remember the full "
"path of executable files to avoid searching the <envar>PATH</envar> time and "
"again to find the same executable. However, the new tools should be used as "
"soon as they are installed. By switching off the hash function, the shell "
"will always search the <envar>PATH</envar> when a program is to be run. As "
"such, the shell will find the newly compiled tools in <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/cross-tools</filename> as soon as they are available "
"without remembering a previous version of the same program in a different "
