"keep them separate from the programs compiled in <xref "
"linkend=\"chapter-building-system\"/>. The programs compiled here are "
"temporary tools and will not be a part of the final CLFS system. By keeping "
"these programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later "
"after their use. This also prevents these programs from ending up in the "
"host production directories (easy to do by accident in <xref "
