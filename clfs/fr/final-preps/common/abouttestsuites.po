"Most packages provide a test suite, usually a script or "
"<command>make</command> target, which tests the just-compiled programs or "
"libraries by executing or linking to them. Test suites are often useful for "
"verifying that a package compiled correctly. However, they cannot be run "
"while cross-compiling so we will not mention test suite commands for any "
"packages until <xref linkend=\"chapter-building-system\"/>."
