"In the final-system build, you are no longer cross-compiling so it is "
"possible to run package test suites. Running the test suite for a newly "
"built package is a good idea because it can provide a <quote>sanity check</"
"quote> indicating that everything compiled correctly. A test suite that "
"passes its set of checks usually proves that the package is functioning as "
"the developer intended. It does not, however, guarantee that the package is "
"totally bug free."

"Some test suites are more important than others. For example, the test "
"suites for the core toolchain packages&mdash;GCC, Binutils, and Glibc&mdash;"
"are of the utmost importance due to their central role in a properly "
"functioning system.  The test suites for GCC and Glibc can take a very long "
"time to complete, especially on slower hardware, but are strongly "
"recommended."

"A common issue with running the test suites for Binutils and GCC is running "
"out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high number of failing "
"tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the most likely cause (if "
"you chrooted) is that the host system does not have the <systemitem class="
"\"filesystem\">devpts</systemitem> file system set up correctly. This issue "
"is discussed in greater detail at <ulink url=\"&faq-root;#no-ptys\"/>."

"Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the "
