"By default, the dynamic loader (<filename "
"class=\"libraryfile\">/lib/ld.so.1</filename>) searches through <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/lib</filename> and <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/usr/lib</filename> for dynamic libraries that are "
"needed by programs as they are run. However, if there are libraries in "
"directories other than <filename class=\"directory\">/lib</filename> and "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/usr/lib</filename>, these need to be added to "
"the <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> file in order for the dynamic "
"loader to find them. Two directories that are commonly known to contain "
"additional libraries are <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/usr/local/lib</filename> and <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/opt/lib</filename>, so add those directories to the "
"dynamic loader's search path."
