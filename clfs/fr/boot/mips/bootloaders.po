"On MIPS based platforms, we have 2 different bootloaders - Colo for the "
"Cobalt based MIPS machines and Arcload for the SGI machines.  At this time, "
"in the boot scenario, the only bootloader we can build and that is usable is "
"Cobalt bootloader. On SGI machines that follow this build method, we "
