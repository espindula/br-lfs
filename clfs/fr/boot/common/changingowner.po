"Currently, the <filename class=\"directory\">/tools</filename> and <filename"
" class=\"directory\">/cross-tools</filename> directories are owned by the "
"user <emphasis>clfs</emphasis>, a user that exists only on the host system. "
"Although <filename class=\"directory\">/tools</filename> and <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/cross-tools</filename> can be deleted once the CLFS "
"system has been finished, they can be retained to build additional CLFS "
"systems. If the <filename class=\"directory\">/tools</filename> and "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/cross-tools</filename> directories are kept "
"as is, the files are owned by a user ID without a corresponding account. "
"This is dangerous because a user account created later could get this same "
"user ID and would own these directories and all the files therein, thus "
"exposing those files to possible malicious manipulation."

"One possible fix for this issue might be to add the <systemitem "
"class=\"username\">clfs</systemitem> user to the new CLFS system later when "
"creating the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, taking care to assign it"
" the same user and group IDs as on the host system. Alternatively, assign "

"<filename class=\"directory\">/cross-tools</filename> directories to user "
"<systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> by running the following "
