"The <filename class=\"directory\">/dev/shm</filename> mount point for "
"<systemitem class=\"filesystem\">tmpfs</systemitem> is included to allow "
"enabling POSIX-shared memory. The kernel must have the required support "
"built into it for this to work (more about this is in the next "
"section). Please note that very little software currently uses POSIX-shared "
"memory.  Therefore, consider the <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/dev/shm</filename> mount point optional. For more "
"information, see <filename>Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt</filename> in "
"the kernel source tree."
