"The directory tree is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) "
"(available at <ulink url=\"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/en/FHS\"/>).  In"
" addition to the tree created above, this standard stipulates the existence "
"of <filename class=\"directory\">/usr/local/games</filename> and <filename "

"to the structure of the <filename "

"directories if you prefer to conform more strictly to the FHS."
