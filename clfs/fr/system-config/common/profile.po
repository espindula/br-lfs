"The shell program <command>/bin/bash</command> (hereafter referred to as "

"an environment to run in. Each file has a specific use and may affect login "
"and interactive environments differently. The files in the <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/etc</filename> directory provide global settings. If an"
" equivalent file exists in the home directory, it may override the global "

"An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using "

"<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file. An interactive non-login shell is "
"started at the command-line (e.g., "
"<prompt>[prompt]$</prompt><command>/bin/bash</command>). A non-interactive "
"shell is usually present when a shell script is running. It is non-"
"interactive because it is processing a script and not waiting for user input"
