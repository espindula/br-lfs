"If the system is going to be connected to the Internet, it will need some "
"means of Domain Name Service (DNS) name resolution to resolve Internet "
"domain names to IP addresses, and vice versa. This is best achieved by "
"placing the IP address of the DNS server, available from the ISP or network "
"administrator, into <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>. If at least one "
"of your network interfaces is going to be configured by DHCP then you may "
"not need to create this file. By default DHCPCD will overwrite this file "
"when it gets a new lease from the DHCP server. If you wish to manually "
"configure your network interfaces or manually set your DNS using DHCP then "
"create the file by running the following:"
