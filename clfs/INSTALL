CLFS Book Conversion Tools Installation Instructions

After downloading the SVN source, there are some things that need to be set up 
on your computer if you want to convert the XML source into something easier to 
read (e.g. HTML, TXT, or PDF).  If you are interested in this, then keep 
reading.  If you are only interested in editing the XML source for re- 
submission to the clfs-commits or clfs-dev mailing lists, then you do not need this 
document.
